  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's a roast, I've got you covered.

Alright, let's dissect this specimen. First off, those glasses are clearly holding on for dear life on that massive forehead. I bet his head casts a shadow in two time zones. And those lips? They look like they're trying to escape his face. I've seen better-defined features on a potato. 

And what's with that expression? It's like he's constantly surprised that he's still breathing. Maybe he should try smiling â€“ but then again, I'm not sure his face muscles are capable of such a complex maneuver. Honestly, he looks like a poorly rendered video game character.

I bet he has a neck like a giraffe and I bet he only has two hairs on his entire head, and his forehead covers half the face, it's so big I bet planes can land on it.</div>
