  <h1>Description for 20250228_063829.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image depicts a wintery scene at dusk or dawn. A layer of snow covers the ground, road, and rooftops. A yellow house with a sharply angled roof is visible behind a snow-covered hedge and a tall evergreen tree. Bare-branched trees stand starkly against a foggy, blue-tinged sky. A fence runs along the edge of the property in the foreground, with the view possibly being taken from inside a building, as a plant is partially visible in the bottom right corner. The scene is illuminated by warm streetlights that cast a yellowish glow on the snow and trees, creating a contrast with the cool blue of the sky.</div>
