  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this Henry battle royale:

<strong>Initial Assessment:</strong>

•   <strong>Roblox Henry</strong> is potentially the most dangerous due to his access to BTools and noclip, giving him immense power.
•   <strong>Rocket League Henry</strong> has mobility and demolishing power.
•   <strong>BFDI Henry</strong> boasts raw strength and durability.
•   <strong>SM64 Henry</strong> has speed, agility, and grabbing ability.

<strong>Detailed Breakdown:</strong>

1.  <strong>Roblox Henry vs. The Field:</strong>
•   If Roblox Henry gets his hands on BTools (especially the deletion tool) early on, he could wipe out the entire competition easily. He can noclip to avoid attacks and delete the ground out from under everyone else.
•   Without BTools, Roblox Henry becomes significantly weaker, being easily killed.

2.  <strong>Rocket League Henry vs. The Field:</strong>
•   Against SM64 Henry, Rocket League Henry has a distinct advantage in mobility and demolishing potential.
•   Against BFDI Henry, the outcome depends on the arena. In an open area, Rocket League Henry can run circles around BFDI Henry. In a confined space, BFDI Henry's strength would be a problem.

3.  <strong>BFDI Henry vs. The Field:</strong>
•   Against SM64 Henry, BFDI Henry has an advantage in a straight fight due to his durability and strength.

4.  <strong>SM64 Henry vs. The Field:</strong>
•   SM64 Henry can outmaneuver almost anyone. But in a confined space, he's toast.

<strong>Predictions:</strong>

•   <strong>If Roblox Henry gets BTools early:</strong> Roblox Henry wins almost certainly.
•   <strong>If Roblox Henry doesn't get BTools:</strong> Things get interesting. It's a fight between the others.

<strong>I'd give the victory to Roblox Henry, assuming he gets the BTools.</strong> His ability to control the environment and delete others is too powerful. <strong>If he doesn't, my money's on Rocket League Henry.</strong> His demolishing ability and speed give him a huge edge over BFDI and SM64 Henry.</div>
