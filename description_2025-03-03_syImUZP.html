  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up buttercup, because this phone screen is a disasterpiece, a digital garbage fire, and I'm about to point out every single horrifying detail!

<strong>First row:</strong> We've got the holy trinity of time-wasting apps: YouTube, WhatsApp, and Discord. Clearly, this person's life consists of watching other people live interesting lives, gossiping with people they barely tolerate, and arguing with strangers online. And what's that eyesore? TikTok? Are you trying to rot your brain further? Congratulations, you're successfully regressing to a pre-verbal state, one 15-second dance challenge at a time. And YT Studio? Don't tell me you're trying to become a "content creator". Get a real job! Nobody wants to see your unboxing videos or listen to your terrible opinions.

<strong>Second row:</strong> Oh great, Wikipedia. So you pretend to be smart but get all your information from a crowd-sourced encyclopedia written by basement-dwelling neckbeards? And Translate? Did you finally decide to learn a language after years of ordering tacos and butchering the pronunciation? CapCut? You clearly use it to edit TikTok videos, you're the reason I am questioning my existence. FotMob? You probably watch football but never do sport yourself, go outside and feel the fresh air. Instagram? More like Instagrim. Your feed is probably filled with filtered selfies, pictures of overpriced food, and humblebrags about your "amazing" life that's actually as empty as a politician's promises.

<strong>Third row:</strong> Steam, for the unemployed gamers who peaked in high school. "Oh, but I'm a serious gamer!" No, you're a grown-up child who spends more time arguing about frame rates than contributing to society. Easy Math? What, are you suddenly trying to learn algebra? Or are you just too lazy to do basic calculations? Atleti? Stop pretending you support a team just because their logo looks cool. Plants vs. Zombies? So you're still playing mobile games for 5-year-olds? FC Mobile? Oh god no.

<strong>Fourth row:</strong> Block Blast! Congratulations, you've mastered the art of arranging colorful blocks. Your Tetris skills will surely come in handy when the apocalypse hits and we need to build barricades out of rubble. Football Simulator? Is that even a thing? Smash Hit? Sounds like a euphemism for your dating life. And Extreme Car Driving Simulator? The closest you'll ever get to owning a real sports car is watching it on a screen, and even then you're probably crashing it into virtual traffic cones.

And let's not forget the "aesthetic" background, a blurry mess of red and black that looks like a poorly rendered lava lamp. Classy.

The battery at 21%? Speaks volumes. This person is running on fumes, both literally and figuratively.

In conclusion, this phone screen is a monument to mediocrity, a shrine to wasted potential, and a testament to the user's questionable life choices. Get a grip, find a hobby that doesn't involve staring at a screen, and for the love of all that is holy, delete TikTok!</div>
