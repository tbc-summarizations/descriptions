  <h1>Description for 1024px-Scotland_national_football_team_logo_2014.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image is a circular emblem representing Scotland, likely a sports or organizational logo, set against a black background. Encircling the central design is a thick ring divided into three concentric bands of white, dark blue, and black. Within this ring, the word "SCOTLAND" is written at the top, and "EST. 1873" is at the bottom, separated by black dots. In the center, there is a shield-shaped design with a gold background decorated with multiple green thistles and a prominent red lion rampant. The shield is bordered by a white line and encompassed by two dark blue swooping shapes that add depth to the logo's design. The overall style is clean and symmetrical, giving it a professional and official appearance.</div>
