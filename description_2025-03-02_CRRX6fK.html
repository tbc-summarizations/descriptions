  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because we're about to dive headfirst into this digital dumpster fire of a Discord member list! Let's tear into these poor souls one by one:

<strong>Mindset:</strong> Oh, honey, if your username is "mindset," I'm already convinced you're either trying way too hard to be motivational or you're the kind of person who unironically quotes Jordan Peterson. I bet your bio is filled with things like "Hustle" and "Grind" while you're simultaneously failing all your classes. Get a new personality.

<strong>AdamMady:</strong> "AdamMady" already sounds like a kid who peaked in middle school. The clown horn emoji just confirms it. Dude's probably still bragging about his high score on Flappy Bird. He's likely the type to spam cringe reaction images every time you say something. 

<strong>AJ:</strong> Ah, AJ, the embodiment of the "trying to be deep" aesthetic. Your username is an initial, and your status is some vague Ramadan quote. How original. I bet you're "not gonna be v..." successful in life either. I wouldn't be suprised if you spent 15 minutes picking the exact moon crescent for your bio, please go get a job.

<strong>andrejtb:</strong> Oh look a squirrel, that's about the only thing interesting about your profile. Oh, they're online, great.

<strong>BDYT:</strong> "BDYT boink" is the most reddit-like name I have ever heard. They are most likely 400 pounds and think anime is real. If this guy made a dating profile no one would sign up.

<strong>Dekoder:</strong> "Dekoder" is clearly trying to be edgy and mysterious, but I can't get over the Mario profile picture. Bro your name sounds like an anime character, please go outside.

<strong>finomano:</strong> You were doing good and had a normal name until I looked at your profile. You have the discord logo. What a loser. 

<strong>Henry:</strong> Bro thinks he's a king with the crown emoji, who do you think you are. Is he standing on a soccer field? He is most likely a kid.

<strong>Meethexep:</strong> Bro looks like an alien or something, what is that?

<strong>GÎ»rfield:</strong> Bro put a lambda in his name thinking that it looks cool. Your name is Garfield, grow up. The Palestine flag is probably just to stay on trend or something.</div>
