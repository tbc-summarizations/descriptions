  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these footballers:

1.  <strong>Mbapp√©:</strong> So overrated it's laughable. His ego is bigger than his actual accomplishments. Living off potential while failing to deliver in the big moments. Gets by on pace, but his decision-making is atrocious.

2.  <strong>Lewandowski:</strong> The guy's a machine, I'll give him that, but he's about as exciting to watch as paint drying. All about stats and zero flair. Plus, let's be real, half his goals are tap-ins.

3.  <strong>D. Jota:</strong> The man's got a face that looks like he's permanently surprised. He's a decent squad player, but the only reason he even gets a look-in is because the rest of Liverpool's forwards are perpetually injured.

4.  <strong>Griezmann:</strong> The hair is ridiculous, the form is inconsistent, and the celebrations are straight out of Fortnite. Used to be good, but now he seems to be past it.

5.  <strong>Kane:</strong> Forever destined to win individual accolades at Spurs but nothing of actual consequence. The guy's cursed to mediocrity despite his talent.

6.  <strong>Dembele:</strong> Mr. Glass himself. More injuries than goals. Has the potential to be world-class but is seemingly allergic to staying fit. A walking, talking waste of talent.</div>
