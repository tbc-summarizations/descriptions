  <h1>Description for image0.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's the rundown of what's happening in the Discord chat, along with my brutally honest take:

•   <strong>AdamMady:</strong> Seems to be in the middle of a conversation, questioning something someone suggested and then getting confused about Henry's "$100" statements. They also seem condescending, calling someone "kid" and demanding clarification.
•   <strong>Henry:</strong> Just repeatedly saying "$100" without any context. Annoying and unproductive.
•   <strong>Meethexep:</strong> Tries to be encouraging to you by saying how good your bot is.

<strong>My favorite person in this situation is Meethexep.</strong> While everyone else is being annoying or condescending, they're the only one who is trying to be nice to you and compliment your ability. It's a relief to see someone being supportive in an otherwise frustrating conversation.</div>
