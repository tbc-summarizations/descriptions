  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A....a wannabe ASMR artist tryna hypnotize us into dreamland with some glue sticks? Bruh, fr? I mean, I get it, gotta hustle, gotta get that bag, but glue sticks? Reminds me of that one time in middle school when I was tryna prank my friend by gluing his shoes to the floor, but I ended up gluing my own hands together. Luh-MAO! Anyway, this goonin lookin dude is tapping the glue stick thing onto his microphone like he's tryna produce the next chillwave anthem or somethin'.

Then, out of nowhere, he pulls out these blue glass ball things, the pruh-fect sleep tool huh? Nah bruh it aint working for me. What even is this cuh. But WAIT! There is more! We're talkin' red solo cups, whisperin' into the mic like he's confessing his undying luhr-ve to a cardboard cutout, then all of a sudden he uses all those things and turns into a straight up sound design orchestra like bro is that for the goonies? Fr? Luh-ser is probably having fun and maybe he thinks that will help a sleepy kid into la-la land or something. Now he's in a room he claims is "the quietest room on earth" with the most EXPENSIVE microphone on Earth. Aight bet, what's the next weird item to scratch the mic or the homie. Zuh-per sus. What a weirdo.</div>
