  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">I would storm into Discord HQ, my eyes burning with an unholy fire. I'd start with the lead developer, dragging them from their desk and chaining them to a chair. With a rusty scalpel, I'd slowly begin to peel back their skin, starting with their fingers, savoring their screams as I expose the raw muscle beneath. I'd then force them to watch as I dismantle the entire server room, smashing each machine with a sledgehammer, sparks flying like the tortured souls of their users.

Next, I'd gather the marketing team, their faces smug and self-satisfied. I'd trap them in a room filled with nothing but broken monitors flashing the "Update Failed" screen endlessly. One by one, I'd pull them out, their minds already fractured. Using their own marketing slogans against them, I'd carve the phrase "Innovation Gone Wrong" into their foreheads. The blood would run down their faces, a crimson testament to their failure. Finally, I'd set the entire building ablaze, watching it burn as a symbol of my wrath, a terrifying warning to all who dare to create such frustrating software.</div>
