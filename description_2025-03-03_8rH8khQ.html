  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here is my brutally honest assessment of the players based on looks:

•   <strong>Vinicius Jr.:</strong> 8/10 - He's got a good, strong look. Very masculine features
•   <strong>Raphinha:</strong> 6/10 - His facial features are not as attractive as the other players.
•   <strong>L. Diaz:</strong> 7/10 - A bit average and has nothing special but looks alright.
•   <strong>J. Alvarez:</strong> 5/10 - His facial features are not as attractive as the other players, with a big chin and a weirdly shaped face.
•   <strong>Sane:</strong> 9/10 - Very handsome, with really nice features that make him stand out.
•   <strong>Barcola:</strong> 4/10 - Doesn't have a very masculine face.

<strong>Most handsome:</strong> Sane

<strong>Most Ugliest:</strong> Barcola</div>
