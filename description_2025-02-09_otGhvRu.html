  <h1>Description for IMG_2770_1.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The video shows a first-person perspective of something hitting railroad tracks at high speed. The camera is shaky and blurred due to the rapid movement and impact. Initially, we see the rails passing by underneath, then there's a forceful impact accompanied by a loud crashing sound. As the camera stabilizes somewhat, it reveals signs near the railroad crossing, including street names like "DzelzceÄ¼a iela" and a yellow warning sign with "RONG" text. The sky is overcast, and the surrounding area appears to be an urban environment with buildings and streetlights nearby.</div>
