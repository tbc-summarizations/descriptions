  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image shows a 3D rendering of a Minecraft villager. The villager has a square head, a large nose, thick eyebrows, and green eyes. He's wearing a brown outfit that appears to have a zipper and a pattern. His arms are crossed in front of him, giving him a slightly stern or disapproving look. The overall style is realistic, rather than pixelated like the original game, suggesting it could be a promotional image or fan art. The background is blurry and dark.</div>
