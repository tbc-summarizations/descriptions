  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image is a screenshot from an app's privacy settings, specifically highlighting the types of data collected by TikTok Ltd. The information is categorized into three sections: "Data Used to Track You," which includes contact info and identifiers used across other apps and websites; "Data Linked to You," which lists a more extensive set of personal data like purchases, location, contacts, search history, identifiers, diagnostics, financial info, user content, browsing history, and usage data; and "Data Not Linked to You," where only usage data is collected without being directly associated with the user's identity. The purpose is to inform users about TikTok's data collection and privacy practices, and there is a link to the developer's privacy policy for more information.</div>
