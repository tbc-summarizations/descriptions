  <h1>Description for IMG_9094.mov</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The media file shows a stationary, brightly lit, double-decker bus at night. The bus is dark in color with white lights, and the route and destination are displayed in large, white lettering. It reads "Orpington, Perry Hall Road, 208." The bus is parked on a wet street, as evidenced by the reflection of the lights in the pavement. As the camera pans along the side of the bus, it can be seen that the seating is grey and blue with yellow handrails. The bus then pulls away from the curb and drives away, its rear tail and turn signal lights flashing brightly in the night.</div>
