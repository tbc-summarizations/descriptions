  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A... tweet from AMD trashing on NVIDIA's RTX 50 series? PRUH, it sounds like they're claiming the RTX 50 is a total GRUH disaster, huh? Developers are saying the GPUs are crashing or barely running older games and software? CUH, that's a major L for NVIDIA if it's true. They supposedly removed 32-bit compute support in OpenCL, CUDA, and Physx? LUH, that's going to anger a bunch of peeps, especially if they still use older programs. And terrible DX9 support? ZUH, that's like stabbing the past in the back, OMAGUH! 

This reminds me of the time when I tried to build my own PC, KID. I spent hours watching YouTube tutorials, but ended up plugging everything in backwards and fried my motherboard, LMAO. Talk about a gooning mistake! Anyway, this tweet is saying NVIDIA basically screwed the pooch with the RTX 50 series. It is possible they took some L's with the RTX 50 Series. If developers are really having those issues with the card then that's bad news bruh! AMD is really tryna get at them. They really cooked! I hope you enjoyed my detailed explanation.</div>
