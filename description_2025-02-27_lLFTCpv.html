  <h1>Description for VID_20250226_091044_244.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The media file is a short video clip, featuring a man dressed in a suit reacting in an exaggeratedly shocked manner. He widens his eyes, pulls at his hair, and yells "What?" repeatedly, looking upwards in apparent disbelief. Text overlayed on the video reads "Jude Bellingham after realizing that Spanish referee can understand English." The man's reaction is likely intended as a humorous portrayal of Jude Bellingham's surprise in a sports-related context, suggesting Bellingham might have said something he shouldn't have if he knew he was being understood. The clip ends with an Instagram handle watermark, likely the source of the meme.</div>
