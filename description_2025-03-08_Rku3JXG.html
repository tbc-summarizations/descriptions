  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Based on the context, AdamMady is the clear winner for me. His dedication to "turning on" his friend's brain with "sexy jurah pictures" is peak humor.

As for andrejtb...oh, honey. You need inspiration, and your friend is trying to help you. Asking if AdamMady wants you to make an African wood house after that offer is like asking a Michelin-star chef if they want you to microwave a hot pocket. Andrejtb, stick to simple designs; anything more complex might break your brain. Also, maybe reconsider your choice of friends.</div>
