  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's a humorous and exaggerated list of punishments for the participants of this chaotic Discord conversation:

•   <strong>"Deleted User" (for starting with "welcome to abc news"):</strong> Forced to host an <em>actual</em> ABC News broadcast, but the autocue is filled entirely with cat facts, conspiracy theories, and the lyrics to the "Baby Shark" song. Every time they stumble, they have to do 100 push-ups while wearing a clown nose.

•   <strong>Meethexep (for simply stating "ono"):</strong> Condemned to a lifetime of only being able to express themselves through poorly-executed haikus about their extreme dissatisfaction.

•   <strong>"Deleted User" (for "Sus amog"):</strong> They must participate in an Among Us tournament where every emergency meeting is interrupted by a dial-up modem sound, and if they are imposter, their kill animation is replaced with a slow-motion sneeze.

•   <strong>Meethexep (for being an "AMORGOS MANAGER"):</strong> Banishment to a remote island where their only job is to manage a herd of angry llamas who are obsessed with optimizing their hay consumption.

•   <strong>"Deleted User" (for the multi-line "Guys..."):</strong>
•   Forced to spend an entire week in a room filled with rubber chickens that constantly squawk every time he moves.
•   Made to sing "Never Gonna Give You Up" in full opera attire at a clown convention.
•   For every time the phrase "Among Us" is uttered, they have to wear an inflatable Imposter costume and do the Macarena in front of a crowd of teenagers.
•   Is forced to write a 10,000-word essay on the sociological impact of the word "SUSSY" on modern society.
•   Forever bound to end every sentence with the letter "m," regardless of context.</div>
