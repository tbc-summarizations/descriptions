OMAGUH, he looking like he goonin for sum gruh fr! What in the actual luhing hell is going on here? Like, is he about to drop the hottest business deal of the century or something? And you know what? I saw this one time at the zoo when a BEAR grabbed my sandwich. ZUH... it was gone in .3 second! But he didn't have no suit on, he was just raw dogging it, ya know? It's like, he just came from the club, ya know?

OMAGUH broooo, this BEAH is serious! Bruh this beah is about to take over the world! He gonna make everyone goonin like that! I bet he drives a fancy car too, one with the leather seats and all that jazz. He's probably got a whole squad of squirrels working for him, doing his dirty work and cuh. Imagine seeing this dude pop out at morning! You'd be like, "Damn, I need to step my life up!" It's like that scene from the movies, where the guy is getting ready and then it shows a BEAH!
