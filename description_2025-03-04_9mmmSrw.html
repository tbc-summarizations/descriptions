  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear these logos apart like they're the hopes and dreams of a washed-up striker! Buckle up, it's gonna be brutal:

1.  <strong>Netherlands (KNVB):</strong> Oh look, it's a lion trying to pass for majestic when it clearly skipped leg day for centuries! Seriously, those twig legs couldn't support a house of cards, let alone a national team. And the color? Orange? Did they lose a bet with a traffic cone? The KNVB looks like they couldn't decide between a medieval coat of arms and a Halloween decoration, so they just slapped 'em together.

2.  <strong>Hungary (Magyar Labdarúgó Szövetség):</strong> What in the communist-era clip art is this?! It's a soccer ball with a severe identity crisis. It seems they put more effort into cramming every imaginable national symbol into a circle than actually designing something appealing. The font looks like it was pulled straight from a 1980s printing press.

3.  <strong>Czech Republic:</strong> Another lion! Did they have a "buy one, get one free" deal at the royal animal depot? This one looks like it's been photoshopped to death and poorly recolored with whatever generic red paint was leftover. The lion has that "I've seen some shit" look in its eyes, probably from having to be associated with this bland design.

4.  <strong>Sweden (Svenska Fotbollförbundet):</strong> Oh, look, they couldn't be bothered with anything more creative than a giant cross and the word "Sweden." Classic example of minimalist design gone wrong; it just looks lazy. The soccer ball up top looks like it's about to fall off, symbolizing Sweden's chances of winning anything significant.

5.  <strong>Croatia (HNS):</strong> What in the checkered flag nightmare is this?! It's like someone threw up a Rubik's Cube on a shield and called it a logo. The ball at the bottom looks like a rejected Easter egg and is definitely out of place. The letters look like they are about to fall out, and that blue line across the middle just screams "bad design choice."</div>
