  <h1>Description for tenor_21831957.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A... giant cockroach chillin' next to this dude on the bed? Bruh, it's like somethin' outta a Kafka novel, but way funnier! This dude's just vibin', sleepin' like he ain't got a care in the world, with a cockroach the size of a small kid cuddled up next to him. Then, outta nowhere, he wakes up and... CUH! All hell breaks loose! He's jumpin' around like he just saw a ghost, bruh! Like someone just pulled him outta his goonin session in the middle of the night, lol. That cockroach costume is gettin' thrown around like it owes him money. It reminds me of the time I accidentally walked in on my lil' brother watchin' some weird anime. Omaguh the horrors, he was traumatized after that. LuL! This is the kinda wake-up call that'll make you question your whole existence. Like, what if we're all just part of some giant cockroach's dream?

Honestly tho, seeing this dude lose his mind over a cockroach, even if it's just a costume, is peak comedy. You know those people that are like "I'm not scared of anything!"? Bet they'd change their tune real quick if they woke up to this pruh! Dude's chasin' it around the room like he's in a Tom and Jerry cartoon, LOL! He's got the moves, the screams, the whole shebang. And the cockroach costume? Yeah, it's seen better days, but it's still holdin' on, even though it's probably wishin' it could just crawl away and disappear. Like, GRUH! What a time to be alive. Who knew a dude fighting a giant cockroach costume could be so entertaining!</div>
