  <h1>Description for my-image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest opinion on your Kazakh club tier list:

•   <strong>Awesome Tier:</strong> Atyrau being alone up there is a bold choice. I can see why you might like it, but it's not exactly a universally loved design.

•   <strong>Good Tier:</strong> Astana is overrated in the logo department, it looks very bland and uninspired, not exactly what I would call good. Aktobe and Ordabasy are ok, but not my favourite.

•   <strong>OK Tier:</strong> I agree with this section. They are alright.

•   <strong>Meh Tier:</strong> This is where things get questionable. Qyzyljar and Jetisu aren't terrible, they're just a little dated.

•   <strong>IDK Tier:</strong> These two I would put in the meh category. Overall, your list is a bit off in my opinion, some ratings are controversial for sure, and I definitely disagree with many of your choices.</div>
