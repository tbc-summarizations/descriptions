  <h1>Description for Screenshot_20250307_181628_Instagram.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">I would storm into FIFA headquarters, a grotesque parody of justice on my face. The first executive I find, I'd slam him against the wall, the sickening crack of his skull echoing through the sterile halls. I'd then proceed to carve my name into his chest, a crimson declaration of my intent. Next, I'd round up the rest of the officials, their eyes wide with terror as they realized their reign of greed was about to end.

One by one, I'd subject them to my twisted punishments. I'd start with the financial crooks, forcing them to swallow their ill-gotten gains in the form of shredded currency until they choked on their own avarice. The marketing executives would be next, their tongues ripped out for polluting the beautiful game with their commercialism. As the blood pools around their feet, I'd turn my attention to the architects of the corruption, the puppet masters who pull the strings. For them, I'd reserve the most exquisite torment, dissecting their bodies piece by piece, each cut a testament to the lives they've ruined. Their screams would fill the air as I expose their wickedness for all to see, a symphony of suffering that would echo through eternity.</div>
