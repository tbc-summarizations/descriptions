  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's get your DSR 9500AX set up. Based on the images and information available, here's a step-by-step guide:

<strong>1. Connecting the Hardware (See back panel image)</strong>

•   <strong>Satellite Dish Connection:</strong>
•   Find the "DISH INPUT 13/18V == 500 mA max." connector on the back of the receiver.
•   Connect the coaxial cable from your satellite dish LNB to this connector.  Make sure the connection is tight.
•   <strong>Connecting to Your TV:</strong>
•   <strong>HDMI (If your TV and receiver have HDMI):</strong>  Unfortunately, based on the image there is no HDMI port. Consider using an alternative connection option.
•   <strong>SCART (Recommended if available):</strong> Locate the "AV1 (TV)" or "AV2(EXT)" SCART connector.  Use a SCART cable to connect this connector to a SCART input on your TV. These are the wider rectangular connectors with many pins.
•   <strong>RCA (Composite Video/Audio):</strong> Locate the "VIDEO OUT" (yellow) and "AUDIO OUT L/R" (white/red) connectors on the receiver. Use RCA cables to connect these to corresponding RCA inputs on your TV.
•   <strong>Power Connection:</strong>
•   Plug the power cord into the "POWER AC100-240V~ " input on the back of the receiver.
•   Make sure the power switch is in the "O" off position before plugging into the mains.

<strong>2. Powering On</strong>

•   <strong>Turn on the TV:</strong> Select the appropriate input source on your TV.
•   <strong>Turn on the DSR 9500AX:</strong> Press the power switch on the back panel to the "I" (On) position. Also press the power button on the front to ensure it is powered on.

<strong>3. Initial Setup (Using a Remote)</strong>

•   Once the system is on, you'll likely see a menu on the screen (based on the provided manual, the menu option "Menu" should display if not, try to see the previous steps were correct).

•   <strong>Language Selection:</strong> Choose "Language Selection" and press "OK". Use the arrow keys to select your language and press "OK" to confirm.

•   <strong>Installation Menu</strong>
•   <strong>LNB Settings (Critical for receiving signal):</strong>
        1.  Navigate to the installation menu (usually item 1). You may need to enter a PIN. If you haven't changed it, it's likely "0000."
        2.  Choose "LNB Settings."
        3.  <strong>LNB Power Supply:</strong> Set to "On"
        4.  <strong>Satellite Selection:</strong> Select the satellite you want to receive.
        5.  <strong>LNB Type (or Frequency):</strong> This depends on your LNB. Common values are 9750/10600 MHz for universal LNBs. You might need to experiment.
        6.  <strong>DiSEqC Mode:</strong> If you have only one dish and one LNB, it should be set to "Off". If you have multiple dishes/LNBs with a DiSEqC switch, configure it accordingly.
        7.  <strong>22KHz:</strong> Experiment with this setting based on your LNB, setting this to Off, on or Auto is what will most often allow for you LNB to work.
        8.  When finished, press "OK" to save.
•   <strong>Automatic Scanning</strong>

        1.  Return to the Installation Menu.
        2.  Choose "Automatic Scanning".
        3.  <strong>Scanning Mode:</strong> Most commonly setting, should be all channels.
        4.  Press "OK" to start scanning for channels.
        5. The receiver will begin searching for channels on the selected satellite. This process can take some time.
        6.  Once the scan is complete, a message will appear with the number of channels found.

•   <strong>Check the signal:</strong>
•   if you are getting No Signal, be sure to check, the "LNB IN" is connected properly to dish, the LNB is correct in settings, and the signal is making it to you home from the service.

<strong>4. Now watch TV</strong>

•   Press the "OK" button on the remote to show channel list.
•   Use the up and down arrows to choose the tv shows to watch.

<strong>Important Notes and Troubleshooting</strong>

•   <strong>No signal</strong>: check connection to lnb, check if power supply is one.
•   <strong>Dish alignment</strong>: check the angle of your tv, ensure it has not changed.
•   <strong>Manual Required</strong>: As this is not an HDMI device, make sure you have a proper tv.
•   <strong>Not working</strong>: check batteries.
•   <strong>Service required</strong>: Get professional help if none of these solutions work.
