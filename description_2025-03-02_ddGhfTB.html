  <h1>Description for IMG_0652.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">To be completely blunt, this did absolutely nothing for me. This is a corny way of motivating anyone. This is essentially the "just be yourself bro" line and it's terrible. It's uninspired and I don't think anyone would go far in life taking this type of advice. It's way too generic and it would be far more helpful if I had some actionable steps to work on.</div>
