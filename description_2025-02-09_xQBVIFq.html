  <h1>Description for readingisquitehard_B-AiPptl9FU.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The media file is a short video clip with a humorous and meme-like quality. It starts with a blue background with white text that says "whale is going poggers." The scene then transitions to a cartoon image of a blue and white whale with a large mouth and prominent teeth, accompanied by a playful-sounding instrumental tune played on wind instruments. The whale appears stationary but the camera rotates around it, showcasing its full cartoonish form. The humor likely stems from the incongruous combination of the phrase "going poggers," a slang term often used to express excitement or approval, with the image of a rather goofy-looking cartoon whale.</div>
