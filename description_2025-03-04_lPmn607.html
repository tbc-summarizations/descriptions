  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these emblems like a crazed fan after a losing game:

<strong>Brazil:</strong>
Okay, Brazil, I see you up there with your five little participation stars. It's cute that you think just because you won a few tournaments decades ago, you're still relevant. That crest looks like a preschooler's finger-painting project gone wrong. What is that sad excuse for a cross? It looks like a melted marshmallow someone stepped on. And those colors? It's like a parrot threw up on a shield. "CBF"? More like "Constantly Being Floundering." The team's style is somehow both boring and chaotic. You can't tell if they're trying to win or just put on a samba show. Also, Neymar is so overrated that he makes Grealish look like Messi.

<strong>Germany:</strong>
Ah, Germany, the land of efficiency and... boring crests. That eagle looks like it's seen one too many World Cup losses and is contemplating retirement. "Deutscher Fussball-Bund" – congratulations, you have a long name. So does my grandma when she’s mad. The black and gold is so drab, it's like watching a soccer game in grayscale. Four stars? That's cute. You used to be relevant, now you are washed up, I mean... Did you even make it out of the group stage in the last two World Cups? Get some new players, or at least some creativity in your logo.

<strong>Italy:</strong>
Italy, the land of passion, drama, and... an inexplicably simple logo. Seriously, it's just the Italian flag slapped onto a shield. You couldn't come up with anything more creative? "FIGC"? Sounds like something you cough up after a bad gelato. Four stars, but let's be honest, those were all won when soccer was played in black and white. Your players are all divas who spend more time arguing with the referee than actually playing. Also, they all dive more than Tom Daley in the Olympics. 

<strong>Argentina:</strong>
Argentina, home of Messi and... a logo that looks like it was designed by a kindergartener with a glue stick. Those laurel leaves look suspiciously like parsley. "AFA"? Sounds like a sneeze. Three stars? Fine, you finally won one recently, congrats to Messi. Before that the team hadn't done anything since Maradona.

<strong>France:</strong>
Oh, France, with your cocky rooster and your two little stars. That bird looks like it's perpetually offended. "FFF"? More like "Forever Floundering Fans." You won a World Cup, congrats, but let's not forget that you also managed to lose to Switzerland in the Euros. Your team is a bunch of prima donnas. Mbappe has too much speed and ego for his own good. 

<strong>Uruguay:</strong>
Uruguay, the forgotten child of South American soccer. Four stars on your crest but it's like nobody knows or cares. That soccer ball looks like a lumpy potato. "AUF"? More like "Always Underestimated &amp; Forgotten". Their last World Cup win was in 1950.

<strong>England:</strong>
England, ah, England, the land of hope and eternal disappointment. Those three lions look like they've been through one too many penalty shootouts. "FA"? More like "Forever Agonizing." One star? That's all you've got? I mean, that's all you deserve. England is famous for overhyping their team every tournament and then choking spectacularly. At least they have Harry Kane, who manages to disappear in big games more consistently than a magician's rabbit.

<strong>Spain:</strong>
Spain, home of tiki-taka and... a logo that looks like a medieval history textbook. All that heraldry just shows how old and stuffy you are. "RFEF"? Sounds like a referee getting booed by the crowd. One star. It's cute that you think winning in 2010 makes you relevant. Your team is now filled with youngsters who think they're the next Xavi and Iniesta.

There you have it – a roast so brutal, it should come with a fire extinguisher. Feel free to ask for more, I’m just getting started...</div>
