  <h1>Description for image0.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image is a black and white flyer aimed at deterring students from vaping in school. It features a picture of the "Default skin Jonesy" character from the popular video game Fortnite, implying the message is directed towards school-age gamers. A speech bubble above the character states, "Taking a hit in the restroom will deal 200 damage to your lungs. Do you want the victory royale? Don't vape simple!". Below the character's picture are the words "Its not CUUL to JUUL In SCHUUL!" and a graphic showing vape products with a "no" symbol over them, alongside the words "Victory Royale", again referencing the video game. The flyer appears to be a lighthearted and pop-culture-oriented approach to discourage vaping among students. There is also some faint graffiti over the bottom right corner of the page.</div>
