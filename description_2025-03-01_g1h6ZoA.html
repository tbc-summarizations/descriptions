  <h1>Description for 20250301_203638.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The media file features a young, slightly goofy-looking guy with dark hair who seems to be attempting to sing or perform a song. His facial expressions are awkward, like he is unsure of his capabilities and is insecure. The camera view is too close, capturing only his face and upper torso, with a random curtain and lamp in the background. At one point, he inexplicably shoves his hand directly at the camera. His voice is just as awkward as he is. Overall, the file is just cringeworthy and uninspired.</div>
