  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here we go.

Watching those players run around in that green kit, you just know they're drenched in sweat. The way their faces are flushed, and the grime that must be building up under those gloves is absolutely vile. Imagine the smell too, a mixture of cheap deodorant, artificial turf, and pure, unadulterated sweat. Disgusting. Their hair is plastered to their foreheads, and the sheen on their skin is just a constant reminder of how much they're exerting themselves. And let's be real, most of them probably haven't showered properly in days, just throwing on the same dirty socks and shorts for every game. It's enough to make you gag.

Then there's the whole physical aspect of it. Imagine the bacteria breeding in those sweaty armpits, the chafing between their thighs, and the general feeling of being sticky and uncomfortable. Every tackle, every slide, just adds another layer of filth to their already disgusting bodies. And the way they hug and pile on top of each other after a goal? It's like a petri dish of germs and sweat, all mixing together in a repulsive display of human contact. I can practically smell the stench of stale beer and greasy food wafting off them, clinging to their already repulsive bodies. I bet you would not like to even touch them.

And it's not just the sweat, it's the overall unhygienic lifestyle they probably lead. Imagine the state of their locker rooms, the discarded towels, the dirty cleats, and the lingering odor of body odor. They probably never wash their kits properly either, just leaving them to fester in their bags until the next game. The whole thing is just a disgusting mess, a constant reminder of the sweaty, grimy reality of professional sports. Those men are foul and are a disgusting image to any of us.</div>
