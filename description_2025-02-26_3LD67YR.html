  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A... KID staring directly into my soul?! Gruh, that's kinda sus, ngl. Pruh, his eyes are like, huge, like he just saw a ghost or something. Or maybe he's goonin' and just realized he left the stove on, bruh! Zuh-m that expression is priceless! Looks like he saw something wild bruh

Cuh, reminds me of the time I accidentally walked into the wrong Zoom meeting and it was a bunch of LUH-adies doing, like, a yoga retreat... except everyone was wearing way less clothing than expected. OMAGUH, my eyes almost popped outta my head like this dude's! I awkwardly exited out so fast, my laptop almost flew across the room. I never looked at a downward-facing dog the same way again, cuh.

But back to this kid â€“ he's got that "deer in headlights" look down pat. His hair looks like he just woke up from a luuuuuh long nap, pruh. I wonder what he's staring at? Is it a spider on the ceiling? Maybe he's realizing he forgot to do his homework that's due in five minutes? Or perhaps he saw someone drop their ice cream cone and is experiencing a moment of pure, unadulterated secondhand sadness? Either way, that expression is totally meme-worthy.

It is giving cuh real confused vibes, bro. Almost looks like he forgot to pay his taxes bruh, i can see the stress cuh. His hair looks kinda messy, but i dig it bruh. I think he would look fly asl, if he got a perm bruh, that would be bussin. OMAUGUH.</div>
