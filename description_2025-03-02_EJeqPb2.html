  <div class="discord-text">Listen here, sonny. You call that belly dancing? A stiff breeze has got more rhythm than what you were just showing. Looks like your trying to start a fire by rubbing two sticks together. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being a real belly dancer, you're a solid 2. Maybe try something else for the talent show, kid, unless your goal is to make the judges laugh. It's more like a belly twitch than a belly dance. You need to let loose and put some effort in if you wanna impress.</div>
