  <div class="discord-text">The image is a vertically-oriented video game stream screen capture. At the top, a streamer with a black face mask and headset appears to be reacting to the gameplay shown below. A text overlay says "NO WIN NO SLEEP -1 BLACK MARK ON THE FACE" and "Wins: 0/20." The gameplay shows a muscular character running on top of a series of cargo containers, with blue pixelated enemies shooting at him.  At the bottom of the screen are a series of icons and text overlays related to viewer interaction on the live stream, like "TAP TAP," "x20," "x60," "x100," "x500," and "+," presumably indicating different kinds of rewards. The icons include hearts, roses, jet planes, boats, and other vehicles. Text overlayed on top of the interaction buttons reads "II. Патńστε yια να παρακολουθήσετε LIVE" (II. Click to watch LIVE).</div>
