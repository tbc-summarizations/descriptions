  <div class="discord-text">Okay, based on the image provided, here's a summary of Kazakhstan's 2024 performances based on the image, along with a very general rating:

<strong>Summary of Kazakhstan's Results:</strong>

•   <strong>Losses:</strong>
•   Lost 5-0 to Greece
•   Lost 2-1 to Luxembourg
•   Lost 3-2 to Azerbaijan
•   Drew 0-0 with Norway
•   Lost 3-0 to Slovenia
•   Lost 4-0 to Austria
•   Won 1-0 against Slovenia
•   Won 2-0 against Austria
•   Lost 5-0 to Norway

•   <strong>Wins:</strong>
•   Won 2-1 against Armenia

<strong>General Assessment:</strong>

•   <strong>Inconsistent:</strong> The results are quite mixed. The team suffered some heavy defeats, which indicates struggles against stronger opposition. However, there are also wins, including a victory over Armenia.
•   <strong>Defensive Issues:</strong> The large number of goals conceded in some matches (5-0 against Greece and Norway, 4-0 against Austria) suggests defensive vulnerabilities.
•   <strong>Potential:</strong> The wins demonstrate that the team is capable of competing and achieving positive results.

<strong>Rating:</strong>

Given the blend of heavy losses and occasional wins, a fair rating for Kazakhstan's 2024 performances based solely on this limited data would be <strong>Average to Below Average (5/10)</strong>.

<strong>Important Considerations:</strong>

•   <strong>Context:</strong> This rating is based <em>only</em> on the scores in the provided image. A more comprehensive assessment would need to consider:
•   The nature of the matches (friendlies, competitive qualifiers, etc.).
•   The opponents' rankings and form at the time.
•   Kazakhstan's squad composition and any injuries.
•   The team's tactical approach.
•   <strong>Ranking in Group:</strong> The performance in qualifiers affects chances of qualifying for a big competition.
•   <strong>Improvement Over Time:</strong> A more in-depth evaluation would consider whether the team showed signs of improvement over the course of these matches.</div>
