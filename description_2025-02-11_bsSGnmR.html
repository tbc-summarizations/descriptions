  <div class="discord-text">The TikTok video showcases various aspects of Kazakhstan's culture and landscape, labeled as "Kazakh Core". It begins with horses in a lush, mountainous region and transitions to cityscape views at dusk. The video then shows a large dish of pilaf being prepared, followed by scenic shots of a turquoise lake surrounded by snow-capped mountains, a woman standing in a field of red poppies, and a group of people dancing in traditional clothing. The video also features a cable car ascending a snow-covered mountain, a snow-covered forest with a bridge over a stream, and a vast sand dune. It ends with a full view of a field covered in red poppies before displaying the TikTok loading screen.</div>
