  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest assessment:

•   <strong>Attractiveness Level:</strong> -20. His unkempt eyebrows and generally unpolished look detract from any potential he might have.

•   <strong>Last Time Talking to a Woman:</strong> Based on his appearance, I'd guess it's been at least a week since he's had a meaningful conversation with a woman outside of family or service interactions.

•   <strong>Likelihood of Having a Girlfriend:</strong> Very low, probably around 5%. His appearance suggests a lack of effort in personal grooming and presentation, which is often a barrier to attracting a partner.</div>
