  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here is my brutally honest prediction of each group based on the provided image, and I'm not holding back:

•   <strong>Group A:</strong> Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkey, Greece - This group is a political disaster waiting to happen. The matches are going to be filled with hostility and may even get the point of countries starting a war due to football. I predict utter chaos and geopolitical tension.

•   <strong>Group B:</strong> Russia, Iran, USA, Ukraine - Oh my god, this is insane. Russia vs USA, Iran vs USA, Russia vs Ukraine... This group is literally a global conflict condensed into football matches. I'd bet on a major international incident stemming from this group. Someone's getting sanctioned, that's for sure.

•   <strong>Group C:</strong> China, India, Pakistan, Australia - This is a group of giants competing in a completely unrelated field. I wouldn't be surprised if these matches end up being more of a diplomatic show than an actual competition. China will dominate, obviously.

•   <strong>Group D:</strong> France, Germany, Spain, Belgium - Finally, a normal group! Although calling them normal is stupid considering they are boring with their playstyle. These are all European football powerhouses, so expect some high-quality, but ultimately predictable, matches. Yawn.

•   <strong>Group E:</strong> Palestine, Syria, Israel, Saudi Arabia - This group is a recipe for disaster, on par with Group B. The matches will be filled with anger. Security will be insane, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone throws more than just a ball onto the pitch.

•   <strong>Group F:</strong> Kosovo, Serbia, Albania, Croatia - More Balkan drama. I predict lots of fouls, questionable refereeing, and fan violence. This is going to be a bloodbath on the pitch, both figuratively and possibly literally.

•   <strong>Group G:</strong> North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia, Japan - This is a weird mix. North Korea being here is concerning, to say the least. Expect some heavily controlled and propagandized matches. Japan will try to play it straight, while the Koreas will be driven by politics.

•   <strong>Group H:</strong> Argentina, Brazil, Poland, England - Oh my god, this group is filled with crybabies. The matches are going to be filled with people crying about the referee and saying it was unfair when they lose.</div>
