  <h1>Description for tiktok_video.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">In this humorous TikTok video, a man and a woman, both dressed in modest attire with the woman wearing a hijab, engage in a game where the man has his mother, who is seated on a couch and using a tablet, read out a list of trending internet slang terms. With each phrase the mother reads, they react with laughter, squirting water on each other as they find the terms absurdly amusing. Some of the phrases include "Delulu," "Slay Queen," "Skibidi Toilet Rizz," "Fanum Tax," and other internet slang that results in even more water being squirted around. The video concludes with the man expressing his gratitude to his mother for her participation in their playful game.</div>
