  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to incinerate these national football teams:

<strong>Group A</strong>

•   <strong>Azerbaijan:</strong> You're like the participation trophy of international football. At least you tried, I guess?
•   <strong>Armenia:</strong> Known more for historical drama than goals. Maybe stick to chess?
•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> The team that always promises so much but delivers disappointment. Your fans are louder than your results.
•   <strong>Greece:</strong> You peaked in 2004, and we haven't heard from you since.

<strong>Group B</strong>

•   <strong>Russia:</strong> Banned from the world stage.
•   <strong>Iran:</strong> You're famous for your politics, not your football. 
•   <strong>USA:</strong> You call it soccer, and the rest of the world laughs. You're getting better, but still painfully average.
•   <strong>Ukraine:</strong> You're going through tough times, but your football won't distract anyone.

<strong>Group C</strong>

•   <strong>China:</strong> You have a billion people, yet you can't field a decent team. What's the excuse now?
•   <strong>India:</strong> Cricket is more popular than football, just shows that nobody likes you.
•   <strong>Pakistan:</strong> You are only good at cricket.
•   <strong>Australia:</strong> Congrats on being the best in Oceania, but let's be real, that's not saying much.

<strong>Group D</strong>

•   <strong>France:</strong> Overrated and relies way too much on individual talent rather than teamwork. Also you colonized a lot of countries.
•   <strong>Germany:</strong> Predictable and boring. You're the team equivalent of beige wallpaper.
•   <strong>Spain:</strong> Tiki-taka is dead. Get over it. Your national identity crisis extends to your football team.
•   <strong>Belgium:</strong> The "golden generation" that never lived up to the hype.

<strong>Group E</strong>

•   <strong>Palestine:</strong> You're playing under impossible circumstances, but let's be real, you're not winning any trophies anytime soon.
•   <strong>Syria:</strong> More conflict than goals.
•   <strong>Israel:</strong> Your country is known for more things than football.
•   <strong>Saudi Arabia:</strong> You guys are terrible at football, maybe stick to oil.

<strong>Group F</strong>

•   <strong>Kosovo:</strong> You're just happy to be here, aren't you?
•   <strong>Serbia:</strong> Always talented, but you self-destruct every major tournament. 
•   <strong>Albania:</strong> You have potential, but you are too small to be noticed.
•   <strong>Croatia:</strong> Your team is as bland as your flag.

<strong>Group G</strong>

•   <strong>North Korea:</strong> Football is propaganda for your dictator.
•   <strong>South Korea:</strong> Always the bridesmaid, never the bride. 
•   <strong>Mongolia:</strong> You can't even handle the Gobi desert, how are you gonna handle the football field?
•   <strong>Japan:</strong> The most disciplined team to be mediocre at football.

<strong>Group H</strong>

•   <strong>Argentina:</strong> Messi or no Messi, you're always choking in big games.
•   <strong>Brazil:</strong> You haven't won a World Cup in ages, and your team is full of primadonnas.
•   <strong>Poland:</strong> Just another European team with nothing special to offer.
•   <strong>England:</strong> The birthplace of football, yet perpetually disappointing. You'll always find a way to lose.

Don't take it personally, it's just football. Now get out there and prove me wrong (but you probably won't).</div>
