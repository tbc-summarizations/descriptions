  <h1>Description for Voice_113.m4a</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, hereâ€™s a millisecond-by-millisecond breakdown, with my brutally honest opinions included:

<strong>0:00 - 0:01:</strong> Sound of children, noisy playground ambiance. The audio quality is really scraping the bottom of the barrel; whoever recorded this should get a new microphone or maybe just find a quieter place.

<strong>0:01 - 0:02:</strong> More of the same annoying noise, like kids are purposely trying to shatter my eardrums.

<strong>0:02 - 0:03:</strong> Sound of a swing creaking. Slow-motion swing movements visible. Visually dull.

<strong>0:03 - 0:04:</strong> Continued swing motion. More of the same god-awful background chatter.

<strong>0:04 - 0:05:</strong> Swing reaching its apex. The kid is just sitting there, not even trying to pump. Total waste of potential energy.

<strong>0:05 - 0:06:</strong> Descent of swing begins. The background noise starts to sound vaguely irritating, akin to that fly you just can't quite swat.

<strong>0:06 - 0:07:</strong> Camera gets slightly unsteady. Probably some unsteady and amateur camerawork.

<strong>0:07 - 0:08:</strong> The swing continues its motion. This is genuinely boring now.

<strong>0:08 - 0:09:</strong> Focus blurs momentarily. The kid is still not doing anything.

<strong>0:09 - 0:10:</strong> Focus regained. The end cannot come soon enough.

<strong>0:10 - 0:11:</strong> End of the video. Finally.</div>
