  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image is a screenshot of a Discord conversation. User "henrythekazakh" states that they're glad they no longer talk to someone, doesn't know what Alan is up to, and mentions an instance of unsubscribing and unfriending someone. User "happymanofficial" posts a screenshot of DMs with "Alan," where Alan exchanges Happy New Year messages, states that they drank beer, and mentions reflux. A TikTok video is also attached. The conversation concludes with "henrythekazakh" commenting "wtf alan drinks now" followed by "happymanofficial" replying "I guess."</div>
