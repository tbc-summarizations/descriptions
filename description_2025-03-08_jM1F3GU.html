  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm not holding back on this one.

<strong>Group A</strong>

•   <strong>Azerbaijan:</strong> Your flag looks like someone threw darts at a map of the Turkic world and then decided to slap a crescent moon on it for good measure. And don't even get me started on your eternal identity crisis.
•   <strong>Armenia:</strong> The colors on your flag are as depressing as your history. Constantly getting steamrolled by bigger neighbors. At least your brandy is decent, I guess?
•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> Your flag is literally just a rip-off of the Ottoman Empire's. Still butthurt about losing all that land, huh? Also, your president is turning you into a dictatorship lite.
•   <strong>Greece:</strong> A flag with too many stripes for a country that's perpetually broke. Your economy is a disaster, your politics are corrupt, and your only claim to fame is ancient history that you're constantly trying to rewrite.

<strong>Group B</strong>

•   <strong>Russia:</strong> Your flag is as bland as your vodka. A corrupt petro-state with a delusional leader who's desperately trying to relive the glory days of the Soviet Union. Your only real exports are oil, gas, and propaganda.
•   <strong>Iran:</strong> Your flag looks like someone scribbled on it in crayon. A theocratic regime obsessed with nuclear weapons and suppressing its own people.
•   <strong>USA:</strong> A flag with more stars than your education system has successes. A country obsessed with guns, consumerism, and electing reality TV stars as president. You also have a healthcare system that bankrupts people for getting sick.
•   <strong>Ukraine:</strong> Your flag is the color of sadness and despair. Your country is a battleground for geopolitical power struggles and corruption.

<strong>Group C</strong>

•   <strong>China:</strong> Your flag is as red as your communist regime. A country that censors everything and oppresses its own people. Also, you have a pollution problem so bad you can barely breathe.
•   <strong>India:</strong> A flag that's as overcrowded as your cities. A country with a caste system that still exists in spirit, and a obsession with beating Pakistan at every given moment.
•   <strong>Pakistan:</strong> Your flag is as green as your army uniforms. A country that can't decide if it wants to be a modern nation or a religious dictatorship.
•   <strong>Australia:</strong> Your flag is just a rip-off of the British one with some stars thrown in. Your entire economy relies on digging stuff out of the ground and selling it to China.

<strong>Group F</strong>

•   <strong>Kosovo:</strong> A flag that looks like a bad PowerPoint slide from a government presentation. You are a country that relies on daddy America in order to be alive.
•   <strong>Serbia:</strong> Your flag is as boring as your cuisine. You lost Kosovo, get over it already.
•   <strong>Albania:</strong> Your flag has an eagle that looks like it just saw a ghost. You are one of Europe's poorest countries.
•   <strong>Croatia:</strong> Your flag has a checkerboard pattern that looks like it belongs on a racing car. You are still dealing with the aftermath of the Balkan Wars and hate Serbians.

<strong>Group D</strong>

•   <strong>France:</strong> A flag as white as your surrender flag... oh, wait. Your country is obsessed with baguettes, berets, and striking every other week.
•   <strong>Germany:</strong> A flag as plain as your sense of humor. You are still paying for the mistakes of your past.
•   <strong>Spain:</strong> A flag as yellow and red as your paella. A country that's perpetually in debt.
•   <strong>Belgium:</strong> A flag as black as your chocolate. A country that no one can explain why exists.

<strong>Group E</strong>

•   <strong>Palestine:</strong> A flag that's just a political statement. You guys are not doing so well.
•   <strong>Syria:</strong> Your flag is as sad as your current situation. A country torn apart by civil war and foreign intervention. Your president is a war criminal.
•   <strong>Israel:</strong> A flag that's as controversial as your existence. You have taken lots of land.
•   <strong>Saudi Arabia:</strong> Your flag has a sword that's as sharp as your human rights record. A country that's rich in oil but poor in freedom.

<strong>Group G</strong>

•   <strong>North Korea:</strong> Your flag is as red as your dictator's face. A country that's a living Orwellian nightmare. Your only export is missiles.
•   <strong>South Korea:</strong> A flag that's as confusing as your pop music. You live in constant fear of your crazy neighbor to the north.
•   <strong>Mongolia:</strong> A flag that's as blue as your endless skies. You have an economy that is nothing to write about.
•   <strong>Japan:</strong> A flag that's as simple as your haikus. You have a declining population and a culture obsessed with robots and anime.

<strong>Group H</strong>

•   <strong>Argentina:</strong> A flag that's as blue as your financial woes. A country that's perpetually on the verge of economic collapse. Also, you lost the Falklands, get over it.
•   <strong>Brazil:</strong> A flag that's as green as your rainforest that you are burning at an alarming rate. A country with a president as crazy as a bag of cats.
•   <strong>Poland:</strong> A flag that's as white and red as your checkered history. You are obsessed with complaining about the past.
•   <strong>England:</strong> A flag that is just the cross of other nations. Also, you are still butthurt about losing all of those wars.</div>
