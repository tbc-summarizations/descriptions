  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A soccer match? PRUH! GRUH! LUH! CUH! ZUH! These dudes look like they just scored a gooooaaaal! Look at the guy in green, he's runnin' like he just won the lottery, man! He's got that "I'm-the-freakin'-GOAT" grin on his face. I remember back in high school, when I scored the winning point in a basketball game. OMAGUH, the feeling was WILD! The crowd was roarin', my teammates were GOONIN' for me. It was the ultimate adrenaline rush, KID. This soccer dude probably feels the same way rn.

Look at 'em now, gatherin' around, all huggy and stuff. It's like a green love fest, yo! They're probably yellin' some crazy stuff in their language, like "We're gonna win the championship!" or "Let's go get some pizza after this!" Who knows, man? Maybe they're plannin' world domination after this. Anyways, I'm just happy for them, KID. It's always good to see people doin' their thang and havin' a good time.</div>
