  <div class="discord-text">Certainly! Here's a description of the media file:

This video offers a glimpse into Atyrau, Kazakhstan, as it appeared approximately 25 years ago, in the year 2000. It showcases various scenes of the city, including aerial views of traffic circles, residential areas, and the Ural River.  There are shots of people walking along the riverbank and fishing, a monument unveiling ceremony, streets with older model vehicles, and glimpses of city landmarks and construction projects of the time. The video is produced with a vintage aesthetic, accompanied by background music, and is credited to "@ZELLO_ATYRAU_REGION" on Instagram.</div>
