  <div class="discord-text">The video depicts a large outdoor stadium at night, illuminated by bright stadium lights. The stadium is packed with spectators, and the field is surrounded by a running track. The track is covered with white squares bearing a red cross, possibly flags or symbols, and a line of people in dark uniforms stand along the edge of the track, seemingly overseeing the event. In the background, on the green field, individuals appear to be walking around, possibly players or staff. The overall impression is that a large sporting event or ceremony is taking place.</div>
