  <div class="discord-text">The media file presents a comparison of Kazakhstan in 1991 and 2024 through a series of video clips. The 1991 footage depicts a snowy, possibly urban environment with people dressed in winter clothing standing on the streets, accompanied by text indicating "collapse of the USSR, poor population, the invisibility of the future." Transitioning to 2024, the video showcases modern cityscapes at night, with illuminated buildings and busy roads, accompanied by text highlighting "one of the best countries in Central Asia," "increase in the welfare of the population by 300%," "the best innovative technologies in the world," "population over 20 million people," and "the highest quality of life index." The contrast between the two time periods is stark, illustrating a significant transformation and positive development in Kazakhstan.  The video is branded with a TikTok logo and the creator's username, @_crazypigg.</div>
