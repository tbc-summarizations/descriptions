  <h1>Description for epic.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The fog hung thick in the air, clinging to the gothic spires of Peach's castle, each stone a silent witness to the tragedy that was about to unfold. SM64 Henry, his once vibrant blue and yellow hues now muted with despair, clung precariously to the low fence, his frame trembling with a bone-chilling fear that transcended the simple horrors of Bowser's castle. He wasn't afraid of death, not anymore. He was afraid of losing the last vestige of hope that flickered within his decaying heart.

It had started innocently enough. A cosmic anomaly, a rip in the fabric of reality that had drawn four disparate souls together: Rocket League Henry, a champion of the arena, his car shimmering with regal blue and gold; Roblox Henry, a blocky avatar radiating a strange, stoic strength; and BFDI Henry, a gentle, unassuming pillow whose face was a constant, comforting smile. They were bound by a shared name, a shared spark of something that resonated beyond their digital forms.

But their sanctuary was shattered. A darkness, ancient and ravenous, had seeped into their newfound world, feeding on their joy, twisting their desires into grotesque mockeries. Roblox Henry, once the bastion of unwavering loyalty, succumbed first. Corrupted by the insidious influence, his blocky form became a vessel of cruelty, his digital eyes burning with a cold, unholy light. He turned on them, his strength amplified, his purpose twisted into the annihilation of everything they held dear.

Rocket League Henry, ever the valiant competitor, faced him head-on. He weaved and dodged, his boost flames painting streaks of defiance against the encroaching shadows. But the arena was no match for the sheer power of corruption. With a sickening crunch of metal and digital code, Roblox Henry crushed him, leaving only fragments of regal paint and shattered dreams scattered across the battlefield.

BFDI Henry, the heart of their little group, was next. He tried to reason, to appeal to the flicker of humanity that might remain within the corrupted avatar. But the darkness had taken root too deeply. With a heart-wrenching sob, BFDI Henry was torn apart, his stuffing scattered like fallen snow, his gentle smile fading into nothingness.

SM64 Henry was the last. He had fled, haunted by the ghosts of his fallen comrades, pursued by the relentless, corrupted avatar. Now, teetering on the edge of oblivion, he looked up at the ominous castle. He knew his fate was sealed. But he also knew that he couldn't let the darkness consume him entirely.

As the blocky figure of Roblox Henry materialized behind him, the fog swirling around its form like a shroud, SM64 Henry closed his eyes. He pictured the shimmering car of Rocket League Henry, the gentle smile of BFDI Henry, the unwavering strength of Roblox Henry before the darkness claimed him. He clung to those memories, to the last vestiges of hope, as the corrupted avatar reached out, its blocky hand closing around his throat.

His final breath was a whispered prayer, a plea for the spark they had shared to endure, to one day ignite again in a new dawn. Then, silence. The fog deepened, shrouding the castle in an eternal twilight, a somber testament to the love and loss of four souls united and tragically torn apart in the digital abyss. The story ends not with an answer or even a resolution, but with the chilling realization that sometimes, the greatest love stories are also the greatest horror stories, forever etched in the haunted landscapes of our memories.</div>
