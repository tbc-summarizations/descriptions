  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because these crests are about to get BURNED.

<strong>Serbia:</strong> Oh, Serbia, you're trying so hard to be regal, but you just end up looking like a medieval flea market. That double-headed eagle? It looks like it's permanently stunned by the existence of the other head. The "Србија" text at the top looks like it was designed by someone who only just learned Cyrillic and is still trying to figure out the kerning. And those fleur-de-lis at the bottom? Did you just steal them from a French grandma's wallpaper? Overall, it's a design that screams "We're trying to be powerful, but our budget was $5."

<strong>Russia:</strong> Ah, Russia, land of bears and questionable governance. Your eagle looks like it's overdosing on testosterone and bad decisions. The three crowns stacked on top? It's like you're trying to compensate for something. And let's not forget the soccer ball awkwardly hanging off the bottom. Is that supposed to represent unity? Because it looks more like the eagle is contemplating whether to eat it or use it as a stress ball. The whole thing just reeks of misplaced grandeur and a desperate need for validation.

<strong>Montenegro:</strong> So, Montenegro, you decided to go with a lion, huh? That's original. It looks like the lion is wearing a crown he stole from Burger King. And the way he's sticking out his tongue makes him look more like he's trying to catch snowflakes than roar with authority. The wheat wreath around the shield? Yeah, because nothing says "fierce" like decorative grains. This whole crest is just... underwhelming. It's like the design team had one good idea and then ran out of money halfway through.

<strong>South Korea:</strong> Okay, South Korea, you went full minimalist, and I'm not sure it works. That tiger looks like it was designed by someone who only saw a tiger from a distance and then tried to recreate it from memory. It's like a Picasso painting of a tiger, but without the artistic merit. And what's with the sharp angles? Is that supposed to represent strength? Because it just looks like the tiger is having a bad hair day. The "KFA" at the bottom is the only part that looks decent, which is a shame.

<strong>Morocco:</strong> Oh, Morocco, you're all about the circles, I see. The crown in the middle looks like it was purchased from a dollar store. The random red stripes under the crown? They don't seem to fit at all with the crest. The text surrounding the circles is fine. All in all the crest is quite bland and is nothing special.

And that's all for today, everyone. Remember, I'm just kidding. Or am I?</div>
