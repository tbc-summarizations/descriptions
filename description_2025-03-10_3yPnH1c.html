  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's address the elephant in the room. If Albania actually managed to pull off a win against England after I laid into them like that, then yeah, I was dead wrong. Utterly, completely, and undeniably wrong. I'd have to eat a massive slice of humble pie, seasoned with a generous helping of "I can't believe that actually happened."

My previous rant was based on cold, hard probability and the sheer disparity in skill and resources between the two teams. If Albania defied those odds and snatched a victory, then kudos to them. They proved me and countless others spectacularly wrong, and they earned every bit of their triumph. I'd tip my hat to their grit, determination, and tactical brilliance (or England's monumental screw-ups).

So, yeah, if they won, I retract every single insult and backhanded compliment I threw their way. They deserve all the bragging rights. I was wrong, they were right, end of story. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go find a bridge to live under.</div>
