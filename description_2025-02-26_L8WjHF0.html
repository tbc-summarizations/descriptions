  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A… tiger in a boat?! Like, bruh, who let Richard Parker out of his cage?! It's all GRUH-OWLING and stuff, probably thinking about goonin' down some lunch, and this kid is just standing there. LUH-ORD, this reminds me of that time I saw a chihuahua trying to fight a Great Dane. Straight-up David and Goliath, except the chihuahua was probably more confident than this dude. CUH-RAZY!

Okay, back to the pic. So, there's this Arabic saying, apparently, but I'm too busy ZUH-OOMING in on that tiger's teeth to care about words right now. He looks like he’s ready to… well, let’s just say he's got a taste for adventure.

Seriously though, this whole scene is like a live-action meme. This kid looks like he's thinking about a new haircut or something. OMAGUH like why are people so unfazed in stressful situations? Bruh and that tiger is out there like “Am I a joke to you?!” GRUH! My uncle had a cat that looked at me like that once, and I swear, it knew all my secrets.

Anyway, this kid is standing and they're just there together. All I gotta say is bruh! CUH! ZUH!</div>
