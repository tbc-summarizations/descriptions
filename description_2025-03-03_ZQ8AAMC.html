  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A.. Kanye West Roblox avatar with like, a super buff bod and tiny little trunks? Bruh, someone spent way too much time goonin' on this creation, I swear. And why is he shiny like a glazed donut? Is that some kinda weird Roblox texture pack?

Okay, so first the dude is just standing there, looking kinda lost, then he brings up the emote wheel, zaps himself with a lightning bolt emote, and sends himself FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. LMAO, it's like when I tried to "manifest" being rich last week by throwing all my money at the sky. Didn't work, btw, just got judged by the birds. Anyway, this is the typa humor that makes me pruh. Like, the unexpected absurdity is chef's kiss. It's like, who even thinks of this stuff? A kid prolly. GRUUUUH. Reminds me of that one time I saw a LUH. I was CUH. I don't think there's anything else here kid.</div>
