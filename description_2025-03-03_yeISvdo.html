  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A... freakin' UFC montage set to some kinda sick beat?! Bruh, this is the kinda stuff that gets me goonin' all day long, cuh! We start off with this dude lookin' all chill, right? Like he just won the lottery or somethin', then BAM, cut to another dude in a fur hat gettin' prepped for a fight! Is he serious, bruh? A fur hat? In the middle of a UFC fight?! That's like showin' up to prom in your grandma's slippers!

Then, oh my God, we're thrown straight into the action. Dudes gettin' smacked around, takedowns left and right, and all I can think is, "Damn, that's gotta hurt." I remember once, cuh, when I was a kid, I tried to do a takedown on my older brother, but he just rolled on top of me and started tickling me mercilessly. I swear I almost suffocated from laughin'! Good ol' times, man. Anyway, back to the video, we got some flag-wavin', some more punchin', and then, boom, the montage is over. Gruh, I'm tryna pruh and fuh, bruh, but I just can't. I just want to see more UFC fights and more people getting smashed. Luh, I am so hyped up after watchin' all of this, I just want to grab zome weights and get swole. Bruh this video just wants me to be like that kid in the "GOONIN" GIF.</div>
