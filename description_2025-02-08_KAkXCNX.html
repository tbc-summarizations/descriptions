  <h1>Description for tenor.gif</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image shows a person lying on a bed in a flooded room. The floor is completely covered in small, round, dark objects, possibly beads or pellets, submerged in water. There's debris floating on the surface and an apparent ring-shaped object. The bed, covered with a red sheet and blue blanket, is situated against a wooden headboard. Various items are visible next to the bed, including what looks like a metal stand and other objects that are partially submerged in the water. The overall scene suggests a significant plumbing issue or other source of major water leakage that has resulted in a highly unusual and possibly hazardous situation.</div>
