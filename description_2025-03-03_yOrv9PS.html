  <h1>Description for IMG_5051.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Oh my god, what is that? Is that supposed to be a chair? It looks like it's been through a war, and lost miserably. The seat is so stained and scratched, I wouldn't be surprised if it was once used as a communal toilet for squirrels. And those legs? They look like they're about to give way any second. I bet if you sat on it, you'd end up on the floor faster than you can say "furniture failure."

And let's not forget that atrocious color combination. Blue and orange? Seriously? It looks like a toddler designed it after a particularly messy finger-painting session. I wouldn't be caught dead with that thing in my house. In fact, I wouldn't even let it near my garbage can, because it would probably contaminate the rest of the trash.

Honestly, I wouldn't wish that chair on my worst enemy. It's a disgrace to furniture everywhere, and it should be ashamed of itself. If I were that chair, I'd crawl into a hole and never come out again. Actually, scratch that - I wouldn't even be able to crawl, because those legs are way too weak. Just pathetic.</div>
