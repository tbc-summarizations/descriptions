  <h1>Description for 20250207_205806.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image shows a disassembled electric scooter with a blue battery pack exposed, resting on a concrete floor. A screwdriver with a red and black handle lies next to the scooter, suggesting it was used in the disassembly process. In the background, a white folding drying rack stands with its packaging in front of it, which displays an image of the rack and the product name "DRYING RACK" with additional details like "18 m drying space," "Foldable," and the dimensions "Size: 60 x 175 x 105 cm". The setting implies that someone is in the process of repairing or modifying the electric scooter in a home or workshop environment.</div>
