  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because these goalkeepers are about to get roasted harder than the pitch in Qatar during the summer:

1.  <strong>Courtois:</strong> Looks like someone tried to sculpt a handsome goalkeeper out of clay, but ran out of clay halfway through the cheekbones. And I'm not sure what's worse, his face or the fact that he plays for Real Madrid.
2.  <strong>Szczesny:</strong> Dude looks like he's eternally questioning his life choices, which is understandable considering he spends his days trying to stop rockets from being launched into the back of the net. Did I spell his name right? Who cares!
3.  <strong>Alisson:</strong> More like All-GONE-in-the-big-games. You'd think with that beard he'd have some wisdom, but he keeps letting goals slip through his fingers. At least he has a nice beard.
4.  <strong>Oblak:</strong> He's giving off serious "dad at a barbeque" vibes, except instead of flipping burgers, he's deflecting shots. But let's be honest, he's probably better at the burgers.
5.  <strong>Neuer:</strong> The terminator of goalkeepers. Cold, calculated, and probably runs on batteries. If you ever need someone to stare down an existential crisis, he's your man. He seems boring as hell.
6.  <strong>Donnarumma:</strong> Looks like he's been through one too many PSG meltdowns. Kid's got the weight of the world on his shoulders, probably because he realizes he's stuck in Paris for the foreseeable future. I feel bad for the guy.

There you have it. Six goalkeepers, six roasts, and hopefully, six people questioning their life choices even more than they already were.</div>
