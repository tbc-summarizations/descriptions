  <h1>Description for attachment.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The attached media file is a screenshot of a scene from an anime-style visual novel. Two characters are prominent in the foreground: a young woman with long, curly purple hair tied in a ponytail, wearing a purple and white dress, and a young woman with short blue hair, wearing a white and gold uniform. The dialogue bubble indicates that the purple-haired woman, Mafuyu, suggests taking on two roles and, as an example, introduces herself as "Darkness Smile Mafuyu." This declaration is accompanied by a change in the screen's tint to a darker, purplish hue. In response to this, another character, Emu, expresses surprise or shock with a "Eep...!" as the scene returns to its normal coloration. The background shows a vibrant amusement park with a Ferris wheel, a carousel, a fountain, and various food stalls, contributing to the overall cheerful yet slightly eerie atmosphere.</div>
