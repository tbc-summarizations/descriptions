  <h1>Description for Screenshot_20250305_083717_Discord.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's the breakdown of what everyone is saying and my brutally honest opinion:

•   <strong>Meethexep:</strong> Responds with "omauguh" and then enthusiastically types "SHOKAI SHOKAI SHOKAI" followed by "gn" (good night). Seems pretty eager to say goodnight to Shokai.

•   <strong>Henry:</strong> Refers to Shokai as "Shokai Bird" and also says "Ok gn". Nothing particularly exciting here.

•   <strong>AdamMady:</strong> Starts off with a simple "oh" and "ok then," but later gets weird. He says "hello," then proclaims "I am the awake" (twice, for emphasis, I guess), which makes zero sense. Then he caps it off with "Hi. I am gonna go to your apartment." This is creepy and potentially threatening.

•   <strong>mindset:</strong> Just politely says "Hi sir". Perfectly normal.

My favorite person in this situation is mindset. They are polite and aren't threatening anyone. AdamMady gives me the creeps.</div>
