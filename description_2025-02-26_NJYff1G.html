  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A... SINK?!?!?!?!?!?!?! IT LUHS LIKE SOMETHING YOU'D SEE IN A PRUH-ANK VIDEO WHERE THEY TRYNA BE ALL EDGY AND SHIT BUT END UP LOOKING LIKE A GOONIN GRUH-MPH! I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, WATAFUK IS GOING ON HERE?!?! IS THAT THING EVEN HOLDING UP?!?! CUHZ IT LOOKS LIKE ONE WRONG BUMP AND THE WHOLE DAMN THING'S GONNA FALL APART! ZUH-MAIGAD! IT'S LIKE THEY TRIED TO REPAIR IT WITH SUPER GLUE AND HOPES AND DREAMS... AND CLEARLY FAILED MISERABLY!

AND HOLY SHIT, THE PLUMBING! IT LOOKS LIKE A BUNCH OF SNAKES HAD A LOVE CHILD WITH A BROKEN WATER HEATER! LUHS LIKE SOMEBODY'S BEEN GOONIN TOO HARD ON THE DRAIN! LIKE, WHO INSTALLED THIS?! A BLIND MONKEY WITH A WRENCH AND A DREAM?! OMAGUH I REMEMBER ONE TIME, I TRIED TO FIX MY OWN TOILET AFTER WATCHING A TUTORIAL ON YOUTUBE. LET'S JUST SAY THAT ENDED WITH ME CALLING A PLUMBER AT 3 IN THE MORNING AND PAYING HIM AN ABSURD AMOUNT OF MONEY TO CLEAN UP MY MESS. NEVER AGAIN WILL I ATTEMPT TO BE A HANDYMAN. IT'S CLEARLY NOT IN MY DNA!

BUT THIS SINK... THIS IS NEXT LEVEL! LUH-IKE, I'M GENUINELY CONCERNED FOR THE WELL-BEING OF ANYONE WHO DARES TO WASH THEIR HANDS IN THAT THING. IT'S A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN! SERIOUSLY, CALL A PROFESSIONAL! ACTUALLY SCRATCH THAT, CALL A DEMOLITION TEAM! JUST BLOW THE WHOLE THING UP AND START OVER! THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO SALVAGE THIS SITUATION!

AND WHAT'S WITH ALL THE GUNK AND GRIME EVERYWHERE?! IT LOOKS LIKE A BIOLOGY EXPERIMENT GONE WRONG! OMAGUH SOMEONE NEEDS TO BREAK OUT THE BLEACH AND SCRUB THIS PLACE UNTIL IT SHINES! CUHZ RIGHT NOW, IT'S JUST A BREEDING GROUND FOR GERMS AND NIGHTMARES! LIKE, I CAN ALMOST SMELL THE MOLD THROUGH THE SCREEN! EWWWWWW! I NEED TO GO WASH MY HANDS NOW... EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT EVEN THERE!

THE FAUCET LOOKS LIKE IT CAME FROM A DIFFERENT ERA! IT'S ALL SHINY AND CHROME, LIKE IT'S TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR THE SHIT SHOW THAT'S HAPPENING BELOW IT. LUHS LIKE IT'S SINGING "ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE" WHILE THE REST OF THE SINK IS COLLAPSING INTO OBLIVION. SERIOUSLY, WHAT A DISASTER MAN I COULDNT IMAGINE DOING THIS AT ALL BRO. LIKE THE THOUGHT OF IT IS JUST PAINFUL TO EVEN IMAGINE MAN.

AND THAT COUNTERTOP OR WHATEVER'S SUPPOSED TO BE HOLDING THE SINK UP... IT LUHS LIKE A PIECE OF CRACKED AND DISCARDED CERAMIC TILE THAT SOMEONE FOUND IN A DUMPSTER AND SAID, "YEAH, THIS'LL WORK!" OMAGUH PLEASE TELL ME I'M DREAMING! IT'S SO THIN AND FRAGILE! I BET YOU COULD BREAK IT WITH A STRONG BREEZE! CUHZ IT LUHS LIKE SOMEONE SPENT ALL THEIR TIME PLAYING VIDEO GAMES INSTEAD OF LEARNING HOW TO DO BASIC HOME REPAIRS. ZUH-MAGAD MAN BRO.

LIKE, DID NO ONE IN THIS HOUSEHOLD HAVE ANY COMMON SENSE?! OMAGUH WERE THEY ALL RAISED BY WOLVES IN A CAVE?! LUHS LIKE BRO WERE ALL GOONIN OR SOMETHIN AND FORGOT. NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE SINK LMAOO! LIKE IT'S BEYOND ME HOW THIS SINK IS EVEN STANDING. LUH-IKE IM IN SHAMBLES RIGHT NOW THINKING ABOUT IT. I ACTUALLY THINK IM GRUH - OH MY GOSH. I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I JUST ALMOST SAID.

I'M STARTING TO THINK THIS IS ALL A PRANK. THAT'S THE ONLY LOGICAL EXPLANATION. NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD ACTUALLY LIVE WITH A SINK THIS SHITTY. RIGHT?!?! PLEASE TELL ME I'M RIGHT! CUHZ IF NOT, I'M GOING TO LOSE ALL FAITH IN HUMANITY! SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT AND NOT A REAL THING! THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE!

OKAY, I NEED TO CALM DOWN. I'M GETTING TOO WORKED UP ABOUT A BROKEN SINK. BUT SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, THIS IS AN ABOMINATION! THIS IS A CRIME AGAINST PLUMBING! THIS IS A BETRAYAL OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND HOLY IN THE WORLD OF BATHROOM FIXTURES! LUHS LIKE SOMEBODY IS TRIPPING BALLS AND SAID "YOLO" AND WENT ALL GOONIN WITH THE SINK.

AND THE FACT THAT WATER IS ACTUALLY COMING OUT OF THE FAUCET IS THE MOST INSULTING THING OF ALL! IT'S LIKE THE UNIVERSE IS MOCKING ME! OMAGUH ITS FUNNY AS FUCK MAN. THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU BUY THE CHEAPEST CRAP AND LET IT ROT. PRUH-OBABLY FORGOT ABOUT MAINTAINING IT. THE SINK DESERVED BETTER THAN THIS! CUHZ, IT LUHS SAD. LIKE A PUPPY BEING LEFT OUT IN THE RAIN!

THIS SINK IS A MESSAGE. A WARNING TO US ALL. IT'S A REMINDER THAT WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF OUR HOMES. THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN QUALITY FIXTURES. AND THAT WE SHOULD NEVER, EVER, ATTEMPT TO FIX OUR OWN PLUMBING UNLESS WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING! AND ESPECIALLY DON'T BE GOONIN! FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY DON'T BE GOONIN! THE SINK'S FUTURE IS IN OUR HANDS! SAVE THE SINKS AND LET IT GRUH-OW!!! AND ZUH... BE FREE.</div>
