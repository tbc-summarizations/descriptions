  <h1>Description for epic.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of the "normality" and sanity of each character, rated on a scale of 1 to 1,000,000 (1 being the least normal/sane, 1,000,000 being the most):

•   <strong>The Rocket League Car (HENRYTHEKAZAKH):</strong> 2/1,000,000 - A car playing a sport with a crown on top while repping Kazakhstan? Absolutely insane. The fact someone is driving that thing with that username, I would probably be scared.

•   <strong>The Roblox Dog with Kazakhstan Flag:</strong> 100/1,000,000 - It's still weird to see a dog representing Kazakhstan in Roblox. It's odd, but at least the representation seems somewhat harmless.

•   <strong>The Pillow with a Military Hat:</strong> 300/1,000,000 - A sentient pillow wearing a military hat? That's pretty strange. It's weird, but at least the character seems somewhat harmless.

•   <strong>Blue-Haired Mario Climbing a Fence:</strong> 150/1,000,000 - Mario with blue hair climbing a fence seems slightly off, and is definitely not normal.

<strong>Conclusion:</strong>

The pillow character with the military hat is the most normal. This is only because everything else is so far fetched that a pillow with a military hat is pretty normal.</div>
