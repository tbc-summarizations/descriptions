  <h1>Description for 800px-Spain_national_football_team_crest.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image is a red and yellow emblem, likely representing the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF).  The main shield-shaped emblem is red with a yellow border and features a detailed coat of arms in yellow.  The coat of arms includes symbols of the kingdoms of Castile, Le√≥n, Aragon, and Navarre, as well as the Bourbon coat of arms. Flanking the coat of arms are the Pillars of Hercules. Below the coat of arms is the inscription "19 RFEF 09" in yellow. Above the main shield, set against a black background, is a single yellow five-pointed star. The star is likely an indicator of the team winning a FIFA world cup.</div>
