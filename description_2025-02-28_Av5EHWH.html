  <div class="discord-text">Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

The image is a close-up selfie of a young person with dark hair and eyes. Their face is illuminated by a strong blue light, which gives their skin an artificial tint. The light source appears to be directly in front of them, emphasizing their facial features like their nose. The background is slightly blurred, showing a neutral colored curtain and the suggestion of dark clothing. The overall composition focuses heavily on the person's face due to the proximity and intense lighting. A download icon is visible in the top right corner of the image.</div>
