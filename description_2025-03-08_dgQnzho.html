  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down Kazakhstan's football performance:

<strong>2022 &amp; 2023: The Golden Years</strong>

Kazakhstan was a force to be reckoned with. Victories over teams like Slovakia and Denmark show they weren't just beating minnows. They were actually playing well and getting results against decent competition. 2023 was especially impressive â€“ topping their group with a string of wins is a testament to significant improvement.

<strong>2024: A Catastrophic Collapse</strong>

Holy hell, what happened in 2024? Those results are an absolute massacre. Getting thrashed by Greece, Austria, and Norway suggests a complete breakdown in tactics, player morale, or both. To go from winning against Denmark to getting humiliated by Slovenia is a massive drop-off. They went from overperforming to being a laughingstock in a year.

<strong>Overall Assessment</strong>

Kazakhstan's 2022-2023 period was undoubtedly a peak. They were performing above expectations and showing real promise. However, 2024 indicates a severe regression, possibly due to coaching changes, player injuries, or just plain bad luck. Either way, 2024 was a complete and utter disaster for them.</div>
