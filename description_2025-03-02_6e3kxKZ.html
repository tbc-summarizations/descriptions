  <h1>Description for SPOILER_IMG_4986.mov</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's the deal with the guy in the video:

The guy in the classroom? Looks like he's trying too hard to be edgy with that buzzed head and "don't mess with me" smirk. Face looks like he's got a permanent "just smelled something bad" expression. Definitely goofy lookin' ass.

I also gotta point out he's probably a terrible student. He looks sleepy, and I don't think he's paying any attention to anyone. Looks like he's getting ready to play some video games.</div>
