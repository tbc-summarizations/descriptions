  <h1>Description for IMG_6999.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image shows two locomotives on a railway track. The locomotives are painted in light gray with red, white, and blue stripes along the side. They are coupled together, and the front locomotive is facing the camera. The trains are at a station platform. The sky is overcast, and there are buildings and trees in the background. Power lines run across the top of the image. The overall impression is that of a somewhat dated photograph, possibly taken with an older camera or scanned from a print.</div>
