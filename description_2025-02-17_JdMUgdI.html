  <h1>Description for vSAhxUe.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image appears to be a screenshot from a video game, likely a fan-made modification of Super Mario 64, given the 3D graphics style and the presence of the Bob-omb Buddy. The player is positioned on a balcony or platform with an ornate railing inside what seems to be a mansion or castle. A black silhouette of a figure is prominently displayed in the foreground, partially obscuring the view, alongside a character with a light blue hat and overalls, suggestive of a modified Mario. The name "henrythekozakh" is written in cyan pixelated text floating above the characters. In the background, there's a window with a warm, glowing light coming from within, and at the top of the screen, there are elements indicating gameplay statistics such as a clock and star counts.</div>
