  <h1>Description for Screenshot_20250226_051630_Twitch.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image is a screenshot of a video call interface, likely from a social media application. On the left side of the screen, a live video feed shows a young man with dreadlocks and a beanie, smiling slightly. Adjacent to his video is a list of contacts, with "Purp" highlighted as being on a call and active. The main part of the screen displays a three-way video call. "Purp" is indicated as no longer present. The other two participants are visible: one is a man with long dark hair and orange glasses, and the third participant is represented by a Bitmoji avatar against a pink background. A chat window is open on the right side of the screen, displaying messages from users, and at the bottom, there are call control buttons and a "Send chat" option. The general aesthetic and icons suggest this is a Snapchat call.</div>
