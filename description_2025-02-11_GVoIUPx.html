  <div class="discord-text">The media file is a video edit featuring a soccer player in a yellow and red striped jersey. The video shows this player engaging in aggressive gameplay, including tackles that cause other players to fall. At one point, the player is seen with blood on his face, and he is later shown saluting. The video includes clips of soccer coach Pep Guardiola looking visibly upset and yelling. The text overlay states, "how that one bro plays with a yellow card," suggesting the player is known for aggressive play even while at risk of further penalty.</div>
