  <h1>Description for videoplayback_4.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here is the transcription of the video:

"Hey guys, logging in here. Just wanted to announce, I am leveraging AI. I am. I mean I just, I didn't really make a big deal about it. I didn't want to like make this big announcement video but it's just one of those things I'm like, I gotta share this with the world. I'm doing it. I'm doing it, guys. I never knew what it meant but now I, I think I, I've used it. I've used AI today, even many times. And look where, look where we are. Look where it gets me, gets me here. Gets me right here. If anyone has any advice on how, wait, I'm just gonna ask AI that question. I'm just gonna ask, I don't even need your advice. Here's what I made."

Summary:
The dude in the video is all excited to announce he's using AI in his life. He acts like he's stumbled onto something profound, when it's really just a basic tech trend. He then shows off a stupid AI-generated 8-bit version of himself.</div>
