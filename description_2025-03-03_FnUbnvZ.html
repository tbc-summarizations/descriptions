  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A... street? Bruh, this looks like some low-budget horror movie scene where the protagonist is about to get gooned on by a shadowy figure lurking in the darkness. Luh, just look at that depressing street! It's like the color palette got lost on its way to the party and decided to take a permanent vacation. And those houses? They look like they're plotting something nefarious, like a secret cult meeting where they discuss the pros and cons of painting their doors a slightly different shade of beige.

The lighting is atrocious! Like, did they hire a blind guy to install those streetlights? They're casting these weird, ominous shadows that make me think a demon is about to pop out and demand I sign a contract with my soul as collateral. Reminds me of this one time when I was walking home late at night and I swear I saw a clown lurking behind a bush. OMAGUH, I sprinted faster than Usain Bolt, kid! Anyway, back to the pic, that car's headlights are like the only source of hope in this desolate landscape. It's like, "Don't worry, little Timmy, I'm here to rescue you from this existential dread!" But honestly, even the car looks like it's contemplating turning around and saying, "Nah, I'm good. You're on your own, buddy." This pic is a symphony of sadness, a ballad of boredom, a haiku of horror. It's the kind of pic that makes you want to curl up in a ball and question all your life choices. Luh.</div>
