  <h1>Description for tenor_21051552.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The media file appears to be a meme featuring two individuals in separate shots. The first shot shows a man dressed in traditional African attire, including a yellow robe and head covering, with the text "I want to offer you a large sum of money" superimposed below him. The second shot shows a man in a business suit sitting at a desk in an office, typing on a keyboard, with the text "Please stop coming here" below him. The juxtaposition of the images and text suggests a humorous scenario, possibly referencing a common stereotype or a scam-like offer.</div>
