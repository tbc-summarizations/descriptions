  <div class="discord-text">The image shows three characters who appear to be models from a video game, likely related to the Half-Life series based on the art style and clothing. The character on the left is a woman wearing a green beanie, a jacket with a Half-Life logo on the arm, and jeans. The middle character is a bald man wearing a light tan sweater and dark jeans, with his arms raised in a celebratory pose. The character on the right is a man with short dark hair, wearing a blue jacket and jeans. All three characters are standing and facing forward, with a neutral background. The lighting suggests they are illuminated by a soft, diffused light source.</div>
