<strong>Lyrics Translation:</strong>

Here's the song's translation:

"I was born and grew up, Oh Dukagjini, my mother,
You gave me birth and raised me.
I am Albanian in Albanian lands,
I am for the honour of our motherland, our freedom...
They call us those of Dukagjini,
And they call us fierce,
Yes, and they call us brave.
Oh, you commander,
Oh, you lion of the brave.
Oh, you trim (brave one),
Oh, you trim in these lands.

Oh, I'm never defeated,
Oh, with all our soul,
We trim the skin.

Oh, we don't give up,
Oh, never, never for sale.

In that mountain, there with the eagles,
Where the light shines,
We have taken an oath.
I am for the honour of our motherland, our freedom.
They call us those of Dukagjini,
We have lived and we will die.
Glory to you, Commander Xhimi,
For Kosovo, we pledge an oath.
Oh, Commander, oh, you lion of the brave.
Oh, you trim, oh, you trim on this ground.
Oh, I'm never defeated,
Oh, with all our soul, we trim the skin.
Oh, we don't give up, oh, never, never for sale."
