  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A... cop? Nah fr tho, this dude's going from 0 to full-on police mode, but like, on a budget, prruh? Starts out with him running cuh, like he's late for some donuts or sumthin, then he upgrades to a skateboard for 50 BUCKS.. Luh, that's like, two coffees these days! Next thing you know, he's on a 100 dollar bike zipping around on his LuH little bike. GRUH. Man is not trying to do the Tour de France!

But THENNNNN, it gets serious. Like, 4500 dollars serious. Bro pulls out a whole electric bike. OMAGUH and that's not even the end. he's got like $6500, $8000, $11000 and $13000 dollar rides! And he's just casual-like riding on his walkie-talkie on all of em... like, dude's just flexing with the TAXPAYERS money for the GOONIN... it reminds me of the time that one kid in my school that was always blabbing about his new toy cars and shit, LUH KID IS A FRAUD... anyway the point is, this is the evolution of a cop, from foot patrol to basically a motorcycle gang member. GOONIN!!</div>
