  <div class="discord-text">Okay, I can do that. Here is the requested response:

<h1>The Football Fanatic Video Of Humor And Insanity</h1>

The video starts with a white background featuring two young boys, one on the left in casual school clothes and a backpack, and the other on the right in a school suit, both waving. Text appears above their heads, with one saying "Pepsi Is Best" and the other saying "Analdu Is Best". Someone responds that both are garbage. The text then says "Analdu and Pepsi, have you gone mad?" then says "Both of these are steam engines". Cut to a football player doing a bicycle kick, then a man in a jacket with a Trollface behind him, then another football player with a Trollface behind him. A Portugal jersey with "Ronaldo" and "7" is shown, with white splatters on it. The video shows Cristiano Ronaldo adjusting his groin, then being attended to by medics on the field. The video ends with the TikTok loading screen. The background is consistently black throughout, except for the white background at the beginning and the individual video clips towards the end. There is music playing throughout.</div>
