  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's a detailed description of the attached media file:

The media is a screen recording of a TikTok Live stream featuring a young person with dark hair, wearing a dark beanie and a light blue sweatshirt. The streamer is participating in a "truth or dare" game with viewers, and a viewer dares them to do five sit-ups. The streamer does the sit-ups while lying down on the floor and breathing heavily. As they do the sit-ups, messages flood the chat, most of which repeat the phrase "AGE OF CONSENT IN SWEDEN IS 15!!!" The streamer completes the challenge and seems surprised and winded. They also appear to be looking over the messages in the chat at the bottom of the screen as they happen. The overall tone of the live stream recording seems lighthearted, but some of the comments in the chat are concerning and potentially inappropriate given the context of the streamer's age or apparent age and location.</div>
