  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this video is about to get roasted harder than a Sunday dinner.

First off, the whole "football is life" caption? Seriously? Is this guy's brain so smooth that the only thing rattling around in there is a soccer ball? I mean, I get it, sports are fun, but if you're prioritizing a game over your own wedding, you might need to re-evaluate your life choices.

And speaking of the wedding, what is that setup? It looks like they're getting married on top of a parking garage. Did they run out of money for a real venue after betting it all on the game? The view might be nice, but the ambience screams "budget wedding."

The bride's face says it all. She looks like she's regretting every decision that led her to this point. You can see the "what have I done?" dawning on her face like the sunrise over that suspiciously-green football field. I bet she's wishing she eloped to Vegas with a blackjack dealer right about now.

And let's not forget about the groom. He's either completely oblivious to his bride's despair or he's just really good at pretending. Either way, his priorities are as messed up as a VAR decision. Dude, put down the binoculars and pay attention to the woman you're about to marry. Unless, of course, she's only marrying you for the free tickets to the games.

Overall, this whole scene is a dumpster fire of questionable life choices and unfulfilled expectations. May their marriage be as thrilling as a nil-nil draw, and may their honeymoon be spent watching reruns of classic games while eating instant noodles on a futon. Congratulations, I guess?</div>
