  <h1>Description for five_nights_at_peru.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image is a screenshot of what appears to be a listing for a mobile game titled "Five Nights at Peru" on the Google Play Store. The game's icon features a man wearing sunglasses. Below the icon and title, it shows the developer as "Clickteam USA LLC". Further down, the listing displays a 4.9-star rating, "110K opiniones," a download size of 104 MB, and a "T" rating for teens. The game is priced at $59.00. Below the price, small thumbnail images appear to show game content, depicting the heads of several young men and an image of what looks like an aquarium. The overall composition of the screenshot is humorously absurd, suggesting the game is a parody or bootleg version of the popular "Five Nights at Freddy's" franchise.</div>
