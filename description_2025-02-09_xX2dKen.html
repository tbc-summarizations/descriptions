  <h1>Description for xi_jinping_gaming.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">This meme combines two separate elements:

1.  <strong>A screen recording of a person playing the "Plague Inc." game.</strong> This game involves creating and evolving a pathogen to infect and ultimately wipe out the world's population. The image shows a map where the disease has originated in China and is rapidly spreading.
2.  <strong>A video of Chinese president Xi Jinping.</strong> The video is overlaid on top of the game, creating the implication that Xi Jinping is responsible for spreading the disease within the game, with the red coloring indicating spread within the game, overlaying the map of the world.

<strong>What it's referencing:</strong>

The meme directly references the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically the conspiracy theory that the Chinese government intentionally created or allowed the spread of the virus. By showing Xi Jinping playing "Plague Inc." while a virus spreads across the world, the meme suggests that the pandemic was a deliberate act. It uses dark humor and satire to express distrust and criticism towards the Chinese government's handling of the initial outbreak.</div>
