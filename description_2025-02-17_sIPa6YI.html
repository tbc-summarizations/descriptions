  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image features two Roblox characters standing next to each other in what appears to be a virtual environment. On the left is a Roblox avatar with a doge head, complete with sunglasses and wearing a black suit with a tie and a small flag of Kazakhstan on its chest. To the right is another Roblox avatar with brown skin, hair, and eyes. This character wears a black and grey cat-patterned jacket, green pants, and white shoes. A small blue bird is perched on the character's shoulder. "Finomano" is written in white text in the upper right portion of the image, possibly indicating the username of the character on the right. The background is blurry and suggests a minimalist setting with bright, neutral tones.</div>
