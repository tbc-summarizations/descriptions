  <div class="discord-text"><h1>Robloxian Wrecks A Ride</h1>

Berishbaev:

•   Freaky Rating: 35/100. Berishbaev is a standard Roblox character, not intentionally freaky.
•   Freaky Recommendation: Add some unexpected accessories like a misplaced limb or glowing eyes to up the creepiness.
•   Looks: 65/100. Clean design, neutral color palette.
•   Looks Recommendation: Could experiment with more personalized accessories to stand out, such as a hat or custom clothing.
•   Sexy: 20/100. Not actively trying to be sexy.
•   Sexy Recommendation: Not applicable, since the avatar is not designed with sexiness in mind.
•   Vulnerability: 90/100. The character's simple form is easy to target.
•   Vulnerability Recommendation: Sticking to group activities and less risky areas in-game can improve chances of safety.

Dog Avatar:

•   Freaky Rating: 60/100. A dog with sunglasses is already mildly absurd.
•   Freaky Recommendation: Adding glitches or unnatural movements could significantly increase the freaky factor.
•   Looks: 70/100. Unique and somewhat trendy with the sunglasses.
•   Looks Recommendation: A small hat or unusual collar might enhance the style without detracting from the overall appeal.
•   Sexy: 30/100. The sunglasses add a bit of "cool" but aren't overtly sexy.
•   Sexy Recommendation: Maybe a subtle wink animation? Not much to build on here.
•   Vulnerability: 75/100. Smaller and seemingly defenseless.
•   Vulnerability Recommendation: Stick close to Berishbaev. Safety in numbers.

OVERALL STATS:

•   Looks Recommendation: Both could benefit from personalized touches without going overboard.
•   Sexy Recommendation: Focus on style and accessories.
•   Vulnerability Recommendation: Teamwork is key.</div>
