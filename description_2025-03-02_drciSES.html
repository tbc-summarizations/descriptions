  <div class="discord-text">The video appears to be an edited close-up of Ryan Gosling. The first shot shows him with his mouth open and an excited expression. The second shot is quickly followed by a fiery animation being placed over his face, with a third eye in the middle of his forehead. The same is done with a lightning animation, and then lastly the image is pixilated and obscured.</div>
