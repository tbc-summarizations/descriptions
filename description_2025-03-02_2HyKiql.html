  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up buttercup, because this is gonna be a wild ride of roasts aimed at this "patriotic" TikTok compilation.

First off, we've got the yelling dude with the Kazakhstan flag. Looks like he's auditioning for the part of "Aggrieved Extra #3" in a low-budget historical drama. His hand is raised so high, it's like he's trying to high-five God. Good luck with that, pal. I'm not even sure that he knows where the heck he is.

Then we cut to a dramatic shot of a statue in the snow. Wow, so edgy! Is this supposed to make me feel something? All it makes me feel is cold, and slightly annoyed that someone decided to film this in portrait mode. It has a statue and people who have Kazakhstan flags, but it is just mid.

Oh, look! It's a flag on a screen. How riveting. I can practically smell the dusty textbooks and stale bureaucracy emanating from this image. Whoever designed that flag should be ashamed. It looks like a sun ate too many lemons and then threw up on a blue tablecloth.

Next, we've got some military guys standing in a field. They look like they're about to embark on a daring mission to... stand around in a field. And what's with the "SAK" patch? Is that some kind of elite unit or just a typo for "SACK"? Either way, they all look like they're ready to fight something, so I wouldn't be so sure.

And now, a dude in a fur hat and draped in a flag. Is he a warrior? A philosopher? Nope, just another generic Instagram influencer trying to cash in on some national pride. Nice hat, bud. Did you borrow it from your grandma? Or a dead animal? I bet it stinks.

Oh good, black and white footage of some old dudes. One of the guys has a bunch of medals and stuff, meaning he probably just got lucky and kissed the right asses. And then more old dudes talking in black and white, trying to make us think that they matter. Get over yourselves, grandpas, no one cares what you have to say anymore. The guy just wants a way to make himself feel superior to the rest of us, when in reality he is just trying to relive the glory of the past.

Now it is a pilot in a jet, like wow. Is this Top Gun: Kazakhstan? Doubt it. This just looks like some dude who got lucky enough to convince someone to let him play with a really expensive toy. What a loser.

More old people talking in a suit! This time, they're holding red books and wearing ties, so you know it's super important. I bet you anything that they have no idea of how to function in the real world at all.

Alright then, now there's a military convoy at sunset, the thing looks like an attempt at the cinematic, but falls flat because it's just soldiers walking, what an unoriginal attempt at being patriotic. They look like the least disciplined troops in all of Kazakhstan.

Oh my god, not another one of those moustaches that look like someone glued roadkill under his nose. What is up with all these creepy dudes staring intensely into the camera? This isn't a movie, dude, it's a TikTok. Get a life.

Finally, there's a shot of soldiers marching. They look like they're about to step into a puddle and ruin their perfectly polished boots. Oh, the tragedy!

And to cap it all off, there is another shot of a suit, he looks like he just got out of the shower after being forced to be the representative of Kazakhstan. He looks like he doesn't want to be here at all, making the video just straight up tragic.

In conclusion, this entire TikTok is a hot mess of clich√©s and generic patriotism. It's like someone took every stereotype about Kazakhstan and crammed it into a 15-second video. Bravo, TikTok user, you've managed to create something that is both deeply boring and mildly offensive at the same time.</div>
