  <div class="discord-text">The media file depicts a man and a young boy in front of a plain white background. The man, who appears to be an adult, is wearing a black t-shirt with the words "NO BULL" printed on it, as well as a black baseball cap. He is speaking directly to the camera. The young boy, positioned to the man's right, is wearing a light blue shirt. He has a playful item on top of his head. Both figures participate in a bizarre act where they both say boom and make exaggerated facial expressions.</div>
