  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's what I see:

This man is not winning any beauty contests anytime soon. He's got that goofy lookin' ass face that would make even a clown question his career choices. The facial expression looks like he's trying to imitate a bulldog choking on a lemon. His hairstyle doesn't help either â€“ it's like a bird's nest had a fight with a bottle of hair gel. All in all, not someone you'd call attractive.</div>
