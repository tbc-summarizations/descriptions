  <h1>Description for tiktok_video.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">I found this video to be a 3/10. I thought it was very juvenile and the water spitting made me cringe. I could tell the goal was to be a 'relatable zoomer' type of thing and the grandma in the back was supposed to be the funny part since she couldn't pronounce the words, but in my opinion it fell short. If this video was created by some 14 year old, then fair enough. I won't judge too harshly. But this creator has been making videos since 2020 and I feel like if you've been making content this long, you have to at least have the bar set at a certain level. This didn't reach it.</div>
