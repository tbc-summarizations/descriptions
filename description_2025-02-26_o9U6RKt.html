  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A...a YouTube comment section unleashing a comedy of errors? Pruh-lease! First, we got @Sonybrr, who's apparently believing that a GPU can conjure dry ice through the sheer power of <em>extreme</em> coolness. I mean, my GPU's kinda hot, maybe I should try <em>unfreezing</em> it to get some! GRUH-hahaha!

Then comes @monky6780 swooping in like the internet's resident dry ice expert, all like, "Thats not how dry ice is made?" No duh, Sherlock! You don't just crank up the AC in your PC and BAM! Dry ice pops out. You need some serious pressure and CO2 manipulation, man!

And then, OH MA GAWD, @Alex-or5wr jumps in with a legendary "Bros Special". Zuh-Wut does that even MEAN?! Is that some kinda secret internet handshake? I'm so lost, like a lu-luh-lost kid in a hardware store.

Wait... Hardware store reminds me of this one time, I was at Home Depot, right? And this old guy was trying to buy a hammer... But he kept calling it a "whack-a-doo". And everyone was just giving him these blank stares. I swear, the cashier was about to explode with laughter! Omaguh, I almost did too. I had to walk away to control myself...

ANYWAY, back to the YouTube comments!

Finally, we have @Vortex_trove, who probably is just the embodiment of sanity in this whole conversation, asking the ultimate question: "Is bro joking or what?" CUH-mon, vortex_trove! It's the internet! Nobody knows what's real and what's a goonin' joke anymore! And with that said. The person is more likely just trying to be funny by saying that the GPU can cause dry ice.</div>
