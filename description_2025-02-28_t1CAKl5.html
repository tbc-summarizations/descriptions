  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's a transcription and translation of the audio in the video, along with a description of what is happening in the video:

<strong>Video Description</strong>

The video displays a messaging conversation. At the top, there is an advertisement for a Mercedes-Benz S 280 being sold for 2,500,000 Tenge. Below the advertisement, there is a conversation between two users. The first user sends the message "Сурет жіберсей," which translates to "Send a picture." The second user replies with an image of a donkey with a Toyota emblem Photoshopped onto its forehead. Following the image, the second user writes, "Камри," which translates to "Camry." Finally, the second user sends the message "Сумен журет кайф," which translates to "Enjoying riding in water." A voice message follows these messages.

<strong>Transcription and Translation of Audio</strong>

• <strong>Audio:</strong> "Ойының кетирмең де. Давай істі береді. Ойынның ұрып кетсің, ойынның азағанымдарға. Серьёзный сөйлесші адам мен. Давай істі қоса майды аға. Өзің мінеп берерсін сумен жүредінің ішек."

• <strong>Translation:</strong> "Don't mess with the game. Let's make a deal. You're ruining the game, those who lost the game. Speak seriously with me. Let's put oil in the deal, brother. You can ride it through the water, intestine."

<strong>Interpretation:</strong>

The tone of the audio suggests the speaker is annoyed or frustrated with the other person's attempt to joke around. The reference to "the game" could mean the car deal or the negotiation process. The speaker is asking the other person to be serious and professional and get the deal done. The last line regarding "riding it through the water, intestine" is likely a continuation of the donkey image and poking fun at the other party's "Camry" joke, implying it is suitable for riding only through water, like a donkey.</div>
