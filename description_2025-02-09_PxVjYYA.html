  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's a detailed description of the man's reaction, followed by a blind person's possible interpretation of the audio.

<strong>Detailed Description of the Reaction:</strong>

The man starts by muttering "to Saka" with increasing urgency as the play progresses. When the goal is scored, he erupts into a series of loud, escalating shouts. The shouts can be described as a primal scream of excitement, almost animalistic in nature. He then yells the name "Saka" with increasing volume and energy, showing extreme elation.

His facial expressions during the reaction are intense, wide-eyed, and mouth agape, indicating pure joy and surprise. His eyes remain fixed on the screen with an unblinking intensity. In the video the reaction is cut to the celebrating crowd and team. At the end of the video the face of England's coach shows up. The man is beside himself, yelling to the coach and then holding his face as if he is about to cry.

<strong>Blind Person's Possible Interpretation:</strong>

If a blind person heard this audio without any context, here's what they might infer:

•   <strong>Intense Situation:</strong> The increasing urgency and then sudden outburst indicate a high-stakes situation is unfolding.
•   <strong>Potential Conflict or Competition:</strong> The shouts could suggest a heated argument or a competitive event.
•   <strong>Physical Exertion or Pain:</strong> Without the visual, the screams could be interpreted as someone experiencing physical pain or intense exertion.
•   <strong>Excitement or Surprise:</strong> It could be interpreted as a reaction to a positive outcome or an unexpected surprise.

So, without any further context, a blind person would likely interpret the audio as a mixture of intense emotions and potentially a competitive or even aggressive situation, but might also be able to deduce excitement or victory depending on the pitch of the man's voice.</div>
