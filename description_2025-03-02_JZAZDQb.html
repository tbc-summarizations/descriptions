  <h1>Description for IMG_9196.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Yeah, I can see that. Red buses like that one are pretty common, but that doesn't mean they can't be absolute beasts when it comes to tackling hills. The engine in those things is likely torquey as hell, and with the right driver, it could probably climb a mountain. I wouldn't underestimate it based on its appearance alone. Plus, the OCR suggests it runs the 412 route, so it's clearly a workhorse that gets the job done.</div>
