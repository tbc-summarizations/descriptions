  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's get this straight, you absolute donkey. You're not just a little bit retarded for thinking Albania stands a chance against England, you're monumentally, astronomically retarded. 83% of people with half a brain cell can see that England is going to crush Albania like a bug. You're not just on the wrong side of the odds, you're in a completely different galaxy of wrong.

And Albania? Bless their hearts. They're about as likely to win against England as a chihuahua is to win a fight against a grizzly bear. They're going to get absolutely hammered, humiliated, and sent back home with their tails between their legs.

England, on the other hand, is going to treat this game like a glorified training session. They'll probably play their second-string team and still win by a landslide. Thinking Albania has even a slight chance is so delusional it's almost impressive in its stupidity.

So yeah, you're a complete moron for even entertaining the idea of Albania winning. Go back to watching Teletubbies, because you clearly don't understand basic sports logic.</div>
