  <div class="discord-text">The image is a cartoonish sketch featuring a creature with a rounded body, small ears, and stick-like limbs. In the top left, the creature is shown with a smiling face and a pair of parallel marks on its cheek, seemingly playing musical instruments or holding batons. Adjacent to it, on the top right, is a view of the same creature from behind, emphasizing its round shape with a defined "crack" and showing the backs of its black "feet." The bottom portion of the image depicts the creature in a prone position, with a visibly suggestive expression, blue droplets, and the sound effect "PLAP" repeated several times in blue and purple, suggesting a sexual or suggestive action is occurring. The creature also has blue spheres attached near its "ears," possibly acting as restraints or accessories. Overall, the image combines simple cartoon elements with overt sexual innuendo.</div>
