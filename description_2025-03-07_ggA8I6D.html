  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my take on why that dude might have been hauling each of those rides into the impound lot:

•   <strong>Running:</strong> Dude probably pissed off the judge one too many times, skipping court appearances. The judge probably said "fine, you have to walk everywhere".
•   <strong>Skateboard:</strong> They probably got caught tearing up private property. "No skateboarding" signs exist for a reason, and some people don't understand boundaries.
•   <strong>Bicycle:</strong> Most people don't obey cycling laws. They probably did something stupid.
•   <strong>Electric Bike:</strong> They probably sped through public property. They probably gave the man a warning for doing something stupid and they did it again.
•   <strong>Electric Dirt Bike:</strong> This could be for noise violations in a residential area or riding where they're not allowed – like on sidewalks or nature trails.
•   <strong>Motorcycle:</strong> A loud muffler and doing wheelies in front of a school.
•   <strong>Dirt Bike:</strong> This guy could have been tearing up a public park or riding without a license and registration. 
•   <strong>Dual Sport Motorcycle:</strong> They probably were too loud for comfort to neighbors.</div>
