  <div class="discord-text">It's hard to give a definitive "average" rating, but here's a breakdown of the setup and how it compares to what a typical Discord gamer might have:

<strong>Strengths:</strong>

•   <strong>Dedicated Monitor:</strong> A large monitor showing discord and a live video stream is a must for a discord gamer
•   <strong>Gaming Mouse:</strong> A mouse with LED lighting like this is a popular among gamers.
•   <strong>Headphones or microphone:</strong> a microphone allows for communication
•   <strong>Gaming Keyboard</strong> the keyboard is a must for any gamer

<strong>Weaknesses:</strong>

•   <strong>Cluttered Desk:</strong> The money and random objects on the desk could be a distraction. Gamers usually prefer a tidy setup.
•   <strong>Laptop:</strong> Laptops are generally seen as less powerful and less optimized for gaming
•   <strong>Poor Lighting:</strong> Gamers usually have a nice array of lights to illuminate the setup.

<strong>Overall:</strong>

This is an okay setup for a gamer who uses Discord. The laptop can handle discord while the player is gaming, and the keyboard is good for gaming. However, the desk looks messy. A discord gamer usually has a nice setup with some form of lighting.</div>
