  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A GUY IN A HOSPITAL BED GLOWING LIKE HE JUST HIT MAX LEVEL IN A VIDEO GAME?!

Pruh, look at this dude, man! He's like a lightbulb on steroids, or something. Is he about to ascend to another dimension or something? Maybe he just won a lifetime supply of lightbulbs and it's the light emitting from his body. I can't believe what I am seeing man. Luh, this reminds me of the time I accidently touched a live wire and felt like every cell in my body had a rave party. But this guy seems more composed than I was when that happened. Back to the goonin though, he really looks like a god cuh. Is there a new religion now? Dude even has a beard, like he's Jesus' long lost cousin or something.

Zuh, that lighting, I bet it's from the hospital lights. They're always weird and glowey, like a scary movie or something. I bet this kid is just really sick or something, and those lights are makin him look all weird. I remember when I went to the hospital after eating 100 hotdogs I could have sworn I looked just like him! But yeah, what I'm saying is, I think bro is gonna turn into a new god kid. I wanna get high with him lol.</div>
