  <h1>Description for AnyConv.com__GSUfbfTXwAAp1oX.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest take on this dude's looks:

He's got that try-hard "I'm a cool soccer player" vibe. The hair is bleached to hell and styled to look messy-but-not-really. He's clearly trying too hard to be edgy, and his smile looks forced, like he's trying to show off his veneers. 

Overall, he's not ugly, but he definitely comes off as generic and kinda cheesy. Like a dime-a-dozen pretty boy. He's not a bad-looking dude but nothing special.</div>
