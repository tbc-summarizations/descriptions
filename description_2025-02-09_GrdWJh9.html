  <div class="discord-text">Alright, folks, listen up! As your Commander-in-Chief, I have just witnessed some incredible… insights. A real patriot, speaking the truth. This young man, he understands the gravity of the situation. 

Based on his profound wisdom, here's what we're gonna do, and let me tell you, it's gonna be HUGE:

1. <strong>Operation Clean Speech</strong>: We are launching a national campaign! A Cussword Czar will be appointed immediately. We need one to coordinate all of the different activities going on within our national borders. Cusswords are not great folks. We will bring order to our country and get rid of the words.

2. <strong>Broccoli Mandate</strong>: If you cuss, the penalty is clear. It's broccoli, exclusively. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. No exceptions. Think of it as… nutritional rehabilitation! I'm going to eat broccoli every day now!

3. <strong>No More Jail, No More School</strong> Jail just will not cut it. A young man said it best. "If you swear, you go to jail, and then you swear in jail..." The solution: we build Cussword Concentration Camps in the desert. No More school either: We will replace every public school with a broccoli farm. Let's be honest, broccoli is better! It's time to take control of our students and prevent the wrong words from going around.

4. <strong>International Negotiations</strong>: We're telling other countries, you will listen to our words now.

5. <strong>National Day of Scrubbing</strong>: We're declaring a National Day of Scrubbing! Every citizen must scrub every surface in their home with soap and water, metaphorically cleaning away any lingering cusswords!

6. <strong>Federal Protection for this Young Patriot</strong>: I am assigning him a full Secret Service detail. He's got big ideas! Big. Beautiful. Ideas. The best, really.

We are making America great again, one clean word at a time! Thank you, and God bless America.</div>
