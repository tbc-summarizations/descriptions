  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Well, well, well, look who got their Viking boats capsized on land! Denmark, oh sweet Denmark, thinking they could just waltz into Kazakhstan and steal some points like they stole those pastries. But no, Kazakhstan showed them what's what. Rasmus HÃ¸jlund with his measly two goals? Please, Abat Aimbetov scored twice himself, including a stoppage-time dagger!

Maybe Denmark should stick to making Lego and leaving the football to the real teams. Enjoy your herring and your tears, Danes. Kazakhstan is rising!</div>
