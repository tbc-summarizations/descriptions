  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Manchester United, losing to Astana 2-1? Seriously? You'd think a club with their history could handle a team from Kazakhstan. Guess not. Maybe they should stick to signing overpriced players and losing in the Champions League. At least Astana knows how to score more than one goal. What a pathetic display from the once-great Red Devils. Astana, on the other hand, showed true grit and determination. Well done to them for exposing United's mediocrity. Maybe Ole Gunnar Solskjaer should consider a career change because managing Manchester United clearly isn't his calling. Astana forever!</div>
