  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A... A DONKEY WITH A TOYOTA EMBLEM STUCK ON ITS HEAD?? LIKE, SERIOUSLY CUH?! PRUH, WHAT IN THE GOONIN' WORLD IS GOING ON HERE? GRUH, I'M SEEING THINGS, RIGHT?

LUH, THIS IS WILDER THAN THAT TIME I ACCIDENTALLY USED MY GRANDMA'S LAXATIVE TEA INSTEAD OF REGULAR TEA. I SWEAR, I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA EXPLODE BRO! OMAGUH, THE MEMORIES STILL HAUNT ME. ZUH, ANYWAY, BACK TO THE DONKEY THING.

LIKE, SOME DUDE IS TRYING TO SELL A MERCEDES-BENZ S 280 FOR 2.5 MILLION TENGE (WHATEVER THAT IS), AND SOMEONE REPLIED WITH A PIC OF A DONKEY WITH A TOYOTA LOGO. PRUH, THAT'S NEXT LEVEL SHADE, KID! GRUH, I'M DYING OVER HERE. I BET THE DUDE SELLING THE BENZ IS PISSED. CUH, HE ASKED FOR A PIC AND GOT A WHOLE ASS MEME.

OMAGUH, I REMEMBER I WAS ONCE TRYING TO SELL MY OLD GAMING RIG AND SOME KID OFFERED ME A PICTURE OF A HALF-EATEN SANDWICH INSTEAD OF MONEY. ZUH, SERIOUSLY! IT WAS THE WEIRDEST THING. LIKE, DUDE THOUGHT HE WAS BEING FUNNY OR SOMETHING. LUH, PEOPLE ARE CRAZY ONLINE, MAN.

BUT BACK TO THE DONKEY, BRO! THIS IS FUNNIER! THE GUY ASKS FOR A PIC AND GETS A DONKEY EQUIPPED WITH A TOYOTA LOGO. CUH, IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE A CAMRY OR SOMETHING? GRUH, THE TEXT SAYS "КАМРИ," WHICH TRANSLATES TO "CAMRY". IT'S REALLY WILD!

THE SELLER IS TRYING TO BE SERIOUS AND THIS IS THE ONLY ANSWER HE GETS. PRUH. I COULDNT HANDLE BEING THE GUY WHO IS SELLING THE BENZ I WOULD LOOSE MY MIND. OMAGUH. CUH, THIS IS INSANE BRO. I CANNOT HANDLE IT.

THEN THE GUY RESPONDS. OMAGUH. THE DUDE IS SO PISSED. HE EVEN MENTIONS HE HAS A DONKEY GOONIN'. PRUH IS THIS WILD?? OR AM I DREAMING. THE DUDE IS ASKING "YOU THINK THATS FUNNY"

LUH THE KID IS REALLY THROWING SHADE HE WONT LET UP. EVEN MENTIONED HIS DONKEY LMAO. THE DUDE JUST SAID HES GONNA PUT IT ON THE DONKEY ZUH!!! GRUH IM CRYING THIS IS SO FUNNY OMAGUH.

I ONCE TRIED TO SELL AN ICE CREAM THAT WAS MELTING AND A KID OFFERED ME HIS OLD MOLDY SANDWICH. ITS CRAZY WHAT HAPPENS ONLINE CUH. OMAGUH!

THEN HE GOES ON TO SHAME HIM EVEN MORE!!! BY TELLING HIM TO JUST RIDE THE TOYOTA LOGO HIMSELF!!! OMAGUH IS THIS CRAZY OR AM I CRAZY. GRUH. IM HAVING A GREAT TIME OVER HERE.

IN CONCLUSION THIS IS JUST AN INSANE IMAGE THAT WAS SENT TO A MERCEDES SELLER FROM A HATER. ITS A DONKEY CUH. WITH A LOGO KID. A TOYOTA LOGO. LUH. OMAGUH. PRUH. GRUH. ZUH. CUH.</div>
