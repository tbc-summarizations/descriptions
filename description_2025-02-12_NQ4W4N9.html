  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's analyze the provided text messages and give some subjective ratings:

<strong>Assumptions:</strong>

•   The context is likely within a chat or social media setting.
•   The user "Greek (@TheGreekDev)" is the subject.

<strong>Ratings (1-100 scale):</strong>

1.  <strong>Funny/Cute:</strong> 65 - The "i have a very strong mental health" and "ill break my keyboard i swear" have some self-deprecating humor that is probably used for comedic purpose.
2.  <strong>Mad:</strong> 60 - The phrase "ill break my keyboard i swear" indicates a high level of frustration, but it doesn't necessarily translate to full-blown anger. The caps-locked "BRUHH" shows frustration, too.
3.  <strong>Racist:</strong> 0 - There is absolutely no indication of racism in any of the messages.
4.  <strong>Good:</strong> 70 - There is no way to judge good or bad.
5.  <strong>Angerness:</strong> 60 - The "ill break my keyboard i swear" and BRUHH shows a lot of anger.
6.  <strong>Sadness:</strong> 30 - There's a hint of underlying sadness with the jokes about mental health, but it's not prominent.
7.  <strong>Total Overall Score:</strong> 50 - A score based on funny/cute, mad, racist, good, angerness and sadness.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong>

•   These ratings are entirely subjective and based solely on the limited text provided. It's impossible to make accurate assessments of a person's character or mental state based on a few online messages.

<strong>Additional Notes:</strong>

•   It's important to be mindful of the context and not jump to conclusions about someone based on brief online interactions.
•   If the messages are part of a larger conversation or a running joke, the ratings might need to be adjusted.</div>
