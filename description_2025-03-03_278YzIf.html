  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A...bruh... is that the dude from the "you know I had to do it to em" meme turned into a blueberry cluster goon? Luuuuuh... I am straight TRIPPIN' cuh. That man's face is lookin' like he's ready to be squished into some primo blueberry muffin or sumthin'. And don't even get me STARTED on the Lazer eyes. Zuuh, what kinda power-up is that? Is he about to unleash some blueberry beam of pure deliciousness?

Reminds me of this one time, when I was a wee lil' kid... Omagah bruh, My mom tried to make me eat a whole bowl of blueberries. Luh. I swear I turned into a violet vegetable myself. Zuuuuh, I was spitting and coughing up those blueberries for days, cuh. This image lowkey triggers my childhood ptsd. I just know that dude is about to preach some blueberry propaganda with those eyes. I ain't falling for it.

It's like, some AI got too high and decided to meld a meme with a fruit salad gone wrong. Pruh. And those sparky eyes, they're like the cherry on top of this... whatever this goonin' is. Luuuuh.. it's both horrifying and hilarious at the same time. I honestly don't know if I should laugh or run for the hills. Gruh.</div>
