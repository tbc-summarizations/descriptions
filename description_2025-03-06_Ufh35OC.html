  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's a story based on the images, presented in a brutally honest way:

John loved to drive but his car was pretty standard so he bought a cheap steering wheel from China to spice it up.

Next, the Chinese guy who he bought it from also started selling the squid game thing and he bought it too.

Now John had to go for a run because he ate too much sugar from the sugar thing he bought, but he bought his shoes off of Alibaba too...

John's feet were hurting so he decided to trim his nails. John had some ugly looking feet so he bought one of those ergonomic nail clipper things that he saw on Facebook from a company called Temu.

John then got tired and went to his bed and went to sleep. But John bought the bed sheets from Temu again.

John then had to go out in the snow and bought some ugly ass looking boots that he saw on Alibaba as well.</div>
