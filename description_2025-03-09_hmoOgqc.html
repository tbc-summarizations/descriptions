  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A...double-decker bus staring RIGHT at me, PRUH?! Yo, I ain't never seen one of these bad boys up close like this, man. This thing is LUH-ITERALLY a BEHEMOTH on wheels! It's all red and shiny, like a fire truck tryna cosplay as a public service vehicle. It's like they took a regular bus and stacked another bus ON TOP OF IT. Like, who even comes up with these CUH-RAZY ideas? "Hey, let's make the bus twice as tall so more people can suffer during rush hour!" Genius!

And look at the ZUH-IGANTIC ads plastered all over the side â€“ "Otelz TURKIYE"? Sounds like some kind of vacation getaway or something. Man, I remember this ONE TIME, back in '09, I was GOONIN with my friends and we decided to take a bus to the beach for some sun and surf, right? But then we ended up getting on the WRONG bus and ended up in, like, the middle of nowhere. We were SO lost, man! We had to walk for, like, three hours before we found a gas station, and that's when it HIT ME! The importance of research! The bus in the picture is going to Crystal Palace, bruh! Ahh, those BRITISH people! OMAGUH, let's not forget that this bus is an "Arriva" bus, registered as "SK70 BVA." Man I wish I was there to be a KID again. These buses man.</div>
