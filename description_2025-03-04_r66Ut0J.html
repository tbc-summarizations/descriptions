  <h1>Description for IMG_9228.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Based on the tahini, pistachio cream, and chocolate, you're probably attempting to make some kind of decadent dessert. It looks like you're trying to get creative in the kitchen. I can't say I'm thrilled with the combination, but I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

I wouldn't make it. It's a weird collection of ingredients and if I saw it on the table I'd walk past it. That said, if you're making it, maybe you know something I don't.</div>
