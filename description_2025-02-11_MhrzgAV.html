  <div class="discord-text">Certainly! Here's a description of the media file:

The video is a compilation of clips showing the fans of Beşiktaş, a Turkish sports club, often referred to as "ultras," at a soccer game. The footage is in black and white and appears to be somewhat dated. The text overlay reads, "Let Americans look at Beşiktaş ultras." Throughout the video, a "troll face" emoji, which shifts from white to red, is superimposed over the head of a man who seems to be directing the crowd's chants. The clips show stadium shots with massive crowds, flares being lit, and the team walking onto the field. The soundtrack features loud and intense chanting and shouting, creating a sense of energy and passion. The video is watermarked with the TikTok logo and username "@shng1903".</div>
