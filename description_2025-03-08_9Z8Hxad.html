  <div class="discord-text">If I were to punish "Jock" for this virtual arson, I'd trap him in a similar environment, except instead of being able to simply walk away, he'd be forced to watch as the fire slowly consumes everything. The heat would be unbearable, the air thick with smoke, and the constant crackling of the flames would be a haunting reminder of the destruction he caused. As the trees turn to charred husks, he'd be left with the chilling realization of the impact of his actions. Only then, when he fully understands the consequences, would he be released, carrying the weight of his wrongdoing forever.</div>
