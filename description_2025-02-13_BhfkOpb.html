  <div class="discord-text"><h1>Restaurant Review With A Heated Response</h1>
The image shows a Google review of a restaurant by a user named Todd, who rates the experience three stars and comments that the service was awful but the food was great, also mentioning that many items were unavailable but that the service was so bad it was entertaining. The review has received 12 "Helpful" votes and an unseen number of "Not Helpful" votes. Below the review, another user has left a comment, heavily censored but revealing a hostile message telling Todd to kill himself and suggesting he try opening his own restaurant.</div>
