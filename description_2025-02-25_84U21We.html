  <div class="discord-text">The media file consists of a montage of clips from a TikTok video that criticizes the socio-economic disparity in Kazakhstan. The video contrasts the lavish lifestyles of the children and relatives of political figures with the poverty and hardship faced by ordinary citizens. It features images of luxury items, opulent events, and allegations of corruption among the wealthy elite, alongside scenes of dilapidated housing, impoverished families, and social unrest. The video culminates with footage of political demonstrations and the forceful response of the police, suggesting a deep-seated discontent and potential for conflict between the ruling class and the impoverished population.</div>
