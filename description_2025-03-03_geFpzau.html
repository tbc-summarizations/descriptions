  <div class="discord-text">The image is a meme comparing "adults from before" to "woke adults now." The "adults from before" section includes an image of a screaming man, a blonde woman with a serious expression, and a woman with a scarf looking resolute. The text below these images reads "Eso es muy Woke!!!" The "woke adults now" section features images of people carrying water jugs and containers, with the text "A $300 el litro de agua!!!!!!" indicating the high cost of water. It's a sarcastic commentary on perceived differences between older and younger generations, possibly suggesting that older generations were more resilient or less concerned with social issues, while the younger generation faces challenges like expensive resources.</div>
