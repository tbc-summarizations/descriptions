  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A...DIAPER?!?! On A CHICKEN?!!! PRUH BRO WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE! First of all, who in their right mind decides to diaper up their chickens?! Are we goonin' here? I remember one time my Luh Aunt tried to put a diaper on her cat, and bro the cat went absolutely ballistic! Scratches, hisses, the whole nine yards. It looked like a scene from a horror movie, cuh! And these chickens are just...standing there? Like, is this their normal? ZUH, this is wild! The music is a banger tho, I ain't gonna lie. But still, diapers on chickens?! I'm tripping out rn. Like, maybe they got tired of the chicken poop all over the house, so they decided, "Aight, we diapering up these cluckers!" I mean, I get it, nobody likes stepping in poop, but like, CHICKENS IN DIAPERS?! I can't get over it, Luh!

AND CUH. ARE THEY GOONIN? I just CAN'T comprehend! This is like something out of a fever dream, Luh. I'm gonna be seeing chickens in diapers in my sleep tonight, I just know it. Like, imagine trying to explain this to someone. "Yeah, bro, I saw this video of chickens in diapers and it was the weirdest thing ever." They'd think I'm a certified loon. I'm telling you, bro, the internet is a wild place. You can find anything on here, from cute kitten videos to...this. PRUH I'm going crazy bro, I was just GOONING. Honestly, I'm kinda impressed, too, though. Like, someone actually took the time to diaper up these chickens. That's dedication, I guess? Either way, it is what it is cuh. I still can't get over the fact that it happened.</div>
