  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the breakdown of those bird images, no sugarcoating:

<strong>Image 1:</strong> This is a straight-up creepy AI creation. The bird's head is unsettlingly smooth, and the eyes are vacant and soulless. The suit looks pasted on, with weird distortions and unnatural shadows around the edges. The colors are unnaturally vibrant, and the overall composition feels off. There is a subtle shift between the eyes every couple of seconds. This is definitely AI-generated.

<strong>Image 2:</strong> Similar to the first image, this one reeks of AI. The bird's head has that telltale smooth, almost wax-like texture that AI often struggles with. The eyes are lifeless and doll-like, lacking any real depth. The suit is poorly integrated with the bird's body, creating a disjointed and unnatural look. The lighting is flat and unconvincing. This is another AI fake.

<strong>Image 3:</strong> This is where things get interesting. While the bird's head still has that slightly unnatural AI feel, it's less pronounced than in the previous images. The eyes have a bit more life to them, and the fur texture is more convincing. The suit is better integrated with the bird's body, and the overall composition feels more believable. However, the lighting still appears unrealistic. This one is most likely AI-generated, but a high-quality one.

<strong>Image 4:</strong> Just like the others, this image is nothing more than a cheaply made AI generated attempt at a bird in a suit. The way the texture of the bird is doesn't make sense and the lack of detail really shines through. This is AI-generated.</div>
