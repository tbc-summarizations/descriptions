  <h1>Description for IMG_9078.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A... a whole lotta Doritos action goin' on up in here! Luh-look at these crunchy bois. We got the "Minecraft Movie Limited Edition" flavors, bro. Talk about a pruh-power move! First up, we got "The Creeper Vinegar." Creeper, more like keeper, because vinegar chips? They're like, the god-tier snack, CUH. Remember that one time me and the bruh were goonin' hard and he threw up after drinking too much apple juice? Like bruh, don't be a KID. Then we got "The Ghast BBQ." BBQ is alrigh i guss idk... bruh...

LUH-ook at the packaging, it's all Minecraft-y, with the pixelated graphics. They call this marketing done right. That's what I call a straight-up money-grab for us goonin kids, but hey, I ain't complaining when it's a bag of chips. The only things I like are the luh-luhs and the money bruh.

I really wanna try the Ghast BBQ because I like the color pink and I just remembered, I have a pink shirt bro so that's gotta mean something! Also, imagine a ghast in real life! Bro that's scary as hell. We have to find a better way to protect our kids in the world bruh. Luh kids are being abused everywhere and it's like nobody does anything about it. We need to do something. I think it's a zuh-zoomer problem, all these young guys are getting to these kids. But hey, that's just my opinion. OMAGUH but this is only my experience kid, so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt. And uh, these chips are recyclable, so it's zuh-zuh-zuh-zuh-zero guilt!</div>
