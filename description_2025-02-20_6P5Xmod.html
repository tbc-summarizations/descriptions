  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here goes. This TikTok video is a comedic reaction to a sports clip of Atalanta captain Rafael Tolói’s red card incident in the Champions League. Mattyfc_, the TikToker, hilariously analyzes and over-exaggerates the events leading up to the red card, from Tolói's initial bump with another player to his clumsy attempts to get the ball. He interjects humorously with sound effects and imagines Tolói’s inner monologue, using motivational video clips with Rocky Balboa's montage, as he tries to get back into the game. This culminates in a clip of the Atalanta coach lamenting that Ademola Lookman is the worst penalty taker he has ever seen, juxtaposed with a clip of a soccer player lamenting an embarrassing loss and referring to a Tottenham coach with a harsh expletive.</div>
