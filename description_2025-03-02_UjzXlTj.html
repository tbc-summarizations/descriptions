  <div class="discord-text">Atyrau in 2000 looks like a depressing shithole that was just coming off the USSR tit. The architecture is bland Soviet era apartment blocks in drab colors, the streets are empty, and the cars are all old and shitty. The river looks polluted, the people look poor and miserable, and everything is rundown and in disrepair. The only positive thing I can say is that there is a small amount of construction going on, which indicates some investment in the city's future. Other than that, it looks like a place that was just struggling to survive.</div>
