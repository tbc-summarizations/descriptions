  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into this dumpster fire of a video, shall we?

First off, we've got these two kids, who look like they're trying to sell me something. One looks like he is selling a new backpack at Sears and the other one looks like his dad is selling a new used car.

Then we cut to the part where Messi and Ronaldo are added into the video and the narrator says “you’re both govn”. I agree, they are govn.

Then we have some random soccer shots. I'm not sure what's worse, the low-quality pixels or the attempt at humor. I'm starting to think the guy who made this video has never touched a soccer ball, or maybe he's just terrible at it.

The person has the nerve to show me a Ronaldo jersey that has clearly had someone’s load busted on it. The jersey is probably being sold on a dark market website.

The video concludes with Ronaldo grabbing his crotch as usual. He probably thinks it’s a big deal.

Overall, this video is a train wreck from start to finish. It's the kind of thing that makes you question humanity's collective intelligence. If this is the future of content creation, I'm out.</div>
