  <h1>Description for SPOILER_IMG_9205_Original.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take:

This dude has a "just rolled out of bed" vibe, and not in a good way. The hair looks like a bird's nest exploded on his head, and he's got that tired "I haven't slept in days" look going on. The patchy facial hair doesn't help â€“ it just makes him look like he's halfway through puberty. Overall, he gives off a "goofy lookin' ass" vibe that wouldn't get a second glance on the street. He needs to put some effort into his appearance if he wants to impress anyone.</div>
