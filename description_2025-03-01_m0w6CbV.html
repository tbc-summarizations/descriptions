  <h1>Description for 20250301_203638.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">This song is a disaster. The amateurish singing is bad and off-key, combined with a voice that sounds like it's still going through puberty. The self-indulgent lyrics, that attempt to convey a sense of intimacy, fail miserably because it's not only corny, but also awkwardly delivered. The lack of musicality and the overall quality is an insult to anyone who has ever made an effort to produce actual art. 

The songwriting shows absolutely no understanding of rhythm, melody, or even basic rhyme schemes. The tone-deafness is painful. The forced emotional depth it tries to convey comes across as immature and shallow. Frankly, anyone listening to this would likely cringe so much that their teeth would hurt. This creation is nothing but garbage.

Musically, there isn't anything to analyze. The song sounds like it was thrown together with zero consideration for how music should sound. It would be a waste of time to even bother picking it apart because it's not worth the effort. The song is a complete failure, showing an absolute lack of talent and artistic vision.
