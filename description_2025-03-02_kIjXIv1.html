  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A Malwarebytes Browser Guard notification?! PRUH, it looks like it popped up because your clipboard was accessed from a website, GRUH. Like, bruh, are you even being careful out here, CUH? You just letting any random site grab whatever you copied? That's kinda zussy, OMAGUH.

This kid kinda reminds me of the time I accidentally pasted my credit card info into a public Discord server, LUH. Luckily, some chill dude PM'd me before anyone could use it. But seriously, don't be like me. Pay attention to those warnings. It's telling you to be sure you trust the site before pasting anything you copied. It's saying, "Hey, fam, don't email your social security number to your boss, goonin ahh." And yeah, it even mentions a terminal, which is like, next-level scary. Imagine pasting some sensitive code snippet into the wrong place. You'd be COOKED. So listen up, yapper. If you're even questioning if you should paste, just DON'T. Disable the warning for the site, bro. Just be safe out there, cuz.</div>
