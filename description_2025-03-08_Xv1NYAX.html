  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, based purely on the teams listed and ignoring any external factors, here's my brutally honest assessment of who would win this competition:

<strong>Brazil</strong>.

Here's why: They are historically a football powerhouse with a consistent track record of success on the world stage. They almost always have a strong squad with world-class players across the board. The image shows teams and their flags and Brazils are clearly on it. 

While Germany, France, Argentina, and Spain are strong contenders, I don't see the other teams even coming close to challenging. My opinion is final. No more information is needed.</div>
