  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because we're about to enter the roast zone.

<strong>Picture 1:</strong>

First up, we have this guy who looks like he raided his grandpa's closet for a suit and raided his grandma's closet for the glasses and found the tie in the back of his toilet tank. I'm not sure what's more offensive, the way his tie looks like it's strangling him or the fact that his hair looks like a cloud that's about to rain dandruff on everyone within a five-mile radius.
His smile looks like a poorly executed "I just robbed a bank" grin. His flag pin is too small to even be a real flag, it's like a smidge of freedom. I can't take him seriously with those glasses. They make him look like the guy who sells knock-off watches on the corner of the street.

<strong>Picture 2:</strong>

And then we have this guy. Looks like he just came from the worst tanning salon known to mankind. I can't tell if he's smiling or grimacing. Maybe it's a combination of both because the wrinkles on his face make him look like a deflated balloon. And that suit? It looks like something a used car salesman would wear. The tie seems like it's trying to escape the gravitational pull of that suit. But let's talk about those eyes. I think he is trying to steal your soul through the picture.

Overall, these guys look like they got dressed in the dark, after drinking way too much moonshine. They might be in charge of countries, but they clearly can't handle a mirror and a decent tailor.</div>
