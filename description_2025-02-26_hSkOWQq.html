  <h1>Description for 0226.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Certainly! Here's a description of the provided media file:

The media file is a short video that combines two scenes. The upper scene features a Roblox environment where three characters (avatars) are present. One character is wearing a top hat and appears to be addressing the other two who are seated. The text on the screen indicates that the character in the top hat is saying, "Do you think that the whole world should obey you just because you have an atomic bomb? You're actually weak, you're afraid of even your own strength". The lower scene shows gameplay from the video game "Subway Surfers". The transition between the scenes is accompanied by a music track, and images featuring profile pictures of avatars follow the initial scenes. These images appear to be related to the Roblox characters from the first scene.</div>
