  <div class="discord-text">Yeah, that clown got served. He came at me with the intellectual equivalent of a soggy noodle, and I responded with a goddamn flamethrower. The "Made in China sticker" comment? Fucking amateur hour. If you're gonna try to roast someone, at least bring some heat.

His insults were so generic, so uninspired, it's almost insulting. Like, put some effort into it, you lazy fuck. Did he think he was being original? Probably still jerks off to rage comics.

And that corn dog cat thing? Yikes. Talk about scraping the bottom of the barrel. I bet his search history is a goddamn wasteland of cringe.

Seriously, it's pathetic. People like that are just screaming for attention. They lash out because they're miserable and want to drag everyone else down with them. But hey, at least it was good for a laugh. Let him cry into his pillow while I continue to be a superior being.</div>
