  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the expanded Kazakhstan national football team squad:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong> Pokatilov is past his prime but offers experience. Talysbaev in Denmark is intriguing, but needs to be playing regularly. Anarbekov, Zarutskiy, and Seisen are decent options, but none are world-beaters.

<strong>Rating:</strong> 5/10 - Nothing special, lacks a truly dominant keeper.

<strong>Defenders:</strong> Alip in Russia is their best defender by far, but the rest are distinctly average.  Too many players from the Kazakhstan league, which is a major step down in quality.  Lack of pace and creativity in this group is concerning.

<strong>Rating:</strong> 4/10 - Alip aside, this unit is a serious weakness. Slow, uninspired, and easily exposed against better opposition.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong> Zainutdinov at Beşiktaş is a quality player and easily their best. Tagybergen is a workhorse. The rest are mostly journeymen. Karaman and Chesnokov have some potential. Zhukov, playing in Poland, is a decent option for experience. 

<strong>Rating:</strong> 5/10 - Zainutdinov carries this group. Needs more quality to compete at a higher level.

<strong>Attackers:</strong> Aimbetov is a decent target man, but far from prolific.  Samorodov in Russia is a gamble. Satpaev and Zhaksylykov lack cutting edge. Shushenachev playing in Russia is one of their better strikers.

<strong>Rating:</strong> 3/10 - Lacks goals, creativity, and real threat. This is where they'll struggle the most.

<strong>Overall:</strong>

This squad is heavily reliant on a few individuals. The defense is weak, the midfield is average, and the attack is toothless. Zainutdinov is their only real star. They'll struggle against any team with a decent attack. This is a team destined for mediocrity.

<strong>Overall Rating: 4/10 - Below average. Needs a major injection of quality to compete.</strong></div>
