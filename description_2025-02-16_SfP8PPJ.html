  <h1>Description for 8mb.video-iVi-jDE9kQcB.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The attached media file is a first-person view video game. The video appears to be of gameplay of Garry's Mod, as a user opens a "Dynamite" menu with a collection of props and objects and then spawns a stick of dynamite in the game world. The user then moves to the location of the dynamite and switches their tool to a machine gun. There is a non-player character crouching ahead, near a light beige military vehicle and a red shipping container. The perspective is from the player's point of view with a focus on the gun, showing the hands holding it and the environment in the distance.</div>
