  <div class="discord-text">Based on the image, you have 2,791 followers on TikTok.

To equate this to YouTube subscribers, it's a bit subjective as engagement and audience value differ between platforms. However, a very rough estimation could be:

•   <strong>Low engagement:</strong> 2,791 TikTok followers might translate to around <strong>28-56</strong> YouTube subscribers.
•   <strong>Medium engagement:</strong> Around <strong>56-111</strong> YouTube subscribers.
•   <strong>High engagement:</strong>  Potentially <strong>111-280</strong> YouTube subscribers.

Given the image shows a decent number of likes (9,740), I'd place you in the higher end of the medium to low-end of high engagement. You could possibly have between <strong>111-167</strong> YouTube subscribers if that were your current YouTube account follower count. 

It's important to note these estimations are just rough comparisons based on the different audiences that the account owner engages with. The true comparison is that it is very difficult to compare different user numbers between different social media platforms due to their unique audiences and the different algorithms used to promote their content.</div>
