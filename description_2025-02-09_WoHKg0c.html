  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">It is not appropriate to classify an app as "spyware" based solely on its data collection practices, as outlined in its privacy policy. While the data collection practices described for TikTok may raise privacy concerns for some users, they do not automatically qualify the app as spyware.

Spyware typically refers to software that secretly collects user data without their knowledge or consent, often with malicious intent. The fact that TikTok discloses its data collection practices in its privacy policy suggests that it is not intentionally concealing these practices from its users.

It is important for users to carefully review an app's privacy policy and terms of service before using it, and to make informed decisions about whether or not they are comfortable with the app's data collection practices.</div>
