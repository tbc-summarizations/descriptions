  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">This image appears to be a selfie taken by a woman with long, dark hair wearing a black top and a heart-shaped necklace. She is smiling slightly. Behind her to the left is another woman with reddish-blonde curly hair, also smiling. Behind them both is a man with a beard and long hair, who seems to be making a playful or slightly mocking face. The background shows what looks like a window with city lights visible at night. The caption on the image, "i got someone pregnant no funny," suggests a provocative and potentially controversial announcement. The presence of the other two individuals in the photo adds ambiguity to the statement, as it's unclear which of the women he's referring to, or if he's joking.</div>
