  <h1>Description for tenor_9861172379046719051.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK bro is that a goonin kid tryna assert his dominance by declaring "ratio" as if it's a magical incantation to win the internet war? Like, bruh, I remember back when I was a lil' guy, I thought shouting "I'm rubber, you're glue" was the ultimate defense against insults. Turns out, reality hits harder than a truck, cuh. Anyway, this dude's got the audacity to claim "Speed better," which, I mean, okay, each to their own, but it's like saying chocolate milk is better than the entire concept of breakfast. It's a statement, sure, but it doesn't mean it's gonna make everyone jump on the bandwagon. He looks like he pruh and gruh up into the sky and thinks he can fly but then he luhing back down to earth because he knows he cant fly he just thought he could.

And yo, let's talk about the drip, or lack thereof. Man's rocking a hoodie that probably cost more than my entire existence but wearing it like he's allergic to fashion. I remember this one time I saw this dude in a full Gucci tracksuit at a gas station. I was like, "Yo, are you here to rob the place or just flex on the poor?" Turns out, he was just buying a lottery ticket. Life's weird, man. But back to this speed kid. He needs a stylist, stat. And maybe a reality check. Calling out someone on the internet ain't gonna make you famous, kid. It's gonna make you another statistic in the vast ocean of online cringe. Omaguh look at him zuhing at his keyboard and saying he is better than the entire internet, goonin at his mom's credit card when she ain't even there! This dude is just a kid, and he doesn't know anything about the real world, and thinks he can beat people over the internet... Omaguh.</div>
