  <div class="discord-text">A man with a beard and dressed in a tuxedo makes a video about how much the United States has changed since he was president. The man looks very much like Abraham Lincoln and mentions that the roads were once dirt when he was in office. He gestures to the street and says, "Now you've got this, whatever this is." He appreciates the growth and number of buildings in the country. The man concludes by saying that the country is a credit to America.</div>
