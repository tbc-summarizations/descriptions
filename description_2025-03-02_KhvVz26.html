  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A racist comment lurkin' in the YouTube chat?! Like, PRUH, lemme tell you, I've seen some wild shit on the internet, but a blatant N-word out in the open like that? GRUH, it's like some outta pocket kid let loose with their parent's account! I remember one time, CUH, I was goonin' around on a livestream, and some zesty ZUH tried to pull the same stunt in the chat. Like, who raised these kids, bruh? OMAGUH

LUH, honestly, it's not even funny. It's just trashy, you know? It's like someone vomited their ignorance all over the screen. Plus, it totally ruins the vibe for everyone else who's just trying to chill and enjoy the content. It's like, come on, bro, get a grip. Go touch some grass or something. Or better yet, go read a book and learn some respect, bruh. OMAGUH, honestly some of this is straight up disgusting and the dude who sent that should get his ass beat, this ain't the 1800s anymore nigga.</div>
