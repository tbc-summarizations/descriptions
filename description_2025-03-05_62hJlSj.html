  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutal analysis of the man's features and attractiveness:

First off, let's talk about the face. The most striking feature is the eyes, which appear to be artificially colored bright blue, giving an unnatural and somewhat unsettling look. The skin is dark, and the face is noticeably chubby, with very prominent cheeks. The nose has a visible piercing, which is a matter of personal taste but doesn't necessarily add or detract from overall attractiveness in this case. The hair is short and neatly cropped, but the hairline seems artificially straight, possibly indicating a wig or severe haircut. The mouth reveals teeth that are noticeably small and uneven, further detracting from the overall aesthetic. He also has a noticeable double chin, which contributes to the roundness of the face and the impression of excess weight.

Moving down, we see a gold chain, which, in this context, looks cheap and out of place. It doesn't complement his features or clothing. His clothing, a white t-shirt, is plain and does nothing to enhance his appearance. He is also wearing a white shirt, and he has short hair. The overall impression is unkempt and lacking in attention to detail. The combination of features creates a look that is far from conventionally attractive.

In terms of attractiveness, I'd rate this man a 12 out of 100. The artificial features, combined with the round face and poorly maintained teeth, create a look that is aesthetically displeasing. The lack of attention to detail in his overall appearance further diminishes his appeal. There's really nothing redeemable in these pictures.</div>
