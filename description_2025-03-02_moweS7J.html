  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image is a screenshot of a Discord conversation between "henrythekazakh" (Berishbaev), "Berishbaev," and "happymanofficial" (HappyMan). The conversation shows henrythekazakh expressing relief that he doesn't talk to certain people anymore and wondering what Alan is up to. He mentions that Alan subscribed to his channel and sent a friend request, but he unfriended Alan because he didn't say anything. The conversation also includes a few direct messages between happymanofficial and Alan where they exchange "Happy New Year" messages and Alan mentions drinking beer and smelling like reflux. The image is concluded with henrythekazakh making a comment about Alan's drinking habits.</div>
