  <h1>Description for BarneyEp1.webp</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">This is a medium shot of Gordon Freeman, the protagonist from the Half-Life video game series. He is seen from the chest up, wearing his iconic orange Hazard Suit. He has short dark hair, light skin, and green eyes. There are cuts and smudges on his face, suggesting he has been through some recent conflict. The background is a blurry, textured gray wall, which helps to isolate him in the frame.</div>
