The title of the image is "Where Europeans Wash Their Hands After Using The Toilet" and includes the subtitle "% who automatically wash their hands with soap &amp; water after going to the toilet*". The data is from a 2015 study conducted by WIN/Gallup International. At the bottom left are copyright, data attribution, and information icons and at the bottom right is the Statista logo. In the lower-left side of the map there is an icon of a sink and water faucet with a water drop coming from the faucet.</div>
