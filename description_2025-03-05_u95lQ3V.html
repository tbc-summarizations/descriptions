  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get this over with.

The "Dubai chocolate" in the image looks like a hot mess. The presentation is terrible. It's just globs of something vaguely chocolate-colored smeared onto what looks like cheap, store-bought cookies. The drizzling is inconsistent and messy â€“ like a toddler did it. Honestly, it looks like something you'd find congealed at the bottom of a dumpster after a heatwave.

Even if it tastes okay, which I highly doubt, the visual is a massive turn-off. You'd be better off buying a pre-made chocolate bar from a gas station. At least it wouldn't look like it was excavated from a sewer. 

In short, it's an unappetizing eyesore. 0/10. Would not eat.</div>
